    "selftext": "To give a bit of context:  \nEmployee attrition is the rate at which employees leave a company. Understanding and predicting attrition is crucial for many companies, as high turnover can lead to increased costs, loss of valuable knowledge, and disruptions in productivity. Attrition analysis can provide insights into why employees leave and help organizations create strategies to retain their talent.\n\nMachine Learning I believe could help in classifying certain people that might leave the company in a bit.\n\nCan anybody enlight me on what to do to utilize Machine Learning on this? Then, what sort of model and metrics to test might be good (according to your experience)? And what should be the pain in doing so?\n\nSome enlightenment would be appreciated! Thanks beforehand :)",

Survival analysis is providing a way to use data from all employees regardless of how long they've been employed. In my experience, the bar for statistical significance is quite high and it mainly served to confirm one source of attrition I knew about. It didn't really help me with potential causes of attrition I was worried about because I just didn't have enough employees in those groups.",
