Though keep in mind that many ML teams are limited more by software engineering than machine learning. Depending on the leadership of the team it might be a smooth transition or you may need to advocate for machine learning projects to transition effectively.\n\nIf you're more into scalability and reliability than the actual user experience, the MLOps team might be a better fit. That said, the teams I've worked with would've been called devops or infrastructure. The folks in those teams were usually very level-headed and wanted to keep everything running smoothly and reduce costs or improve security over time. Also keep in mind that spending days working on AWS/Terraform/etc can feel VERY different than coding. If you haven't experienced it before I'd suggest trying that out when you get a chance to see if you like it; many frontend and backend engineers I've known loathe it.\n\nAll that said, it's really important that you like the people you're working with (and for). It's probably more important than exactly which area you work in, because a really good team will give you the space and support to learn and grow.",
