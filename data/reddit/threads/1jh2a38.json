Its been a year since I have last published and I would like to participate as a reviewer at these conferences. I am a masters graduate.\n\n1) What are the requirements to be a reviewer?  \n2) I dont see applications for reviewers in most conferences, so How do I become one? Do I just email the chairs from the conference?\n\nAny advice is appreciated. TIA!!",
