How do you learn with it?\n\n  \n**I personally find it very useful**. I always ask `o1/o3-mini-high` to **generate a long output of a LaTeX document, which I then dissect into smaller, more manageable chunks and work on my way up there.** That is how I effectively learn **ML/DL concepts**. I also ask it to mention all the details.\n\n  \n**Would love to hear some of your thoughts and how to improve learning!**",

Occasionally, you might also be able to clear up misunderstandings you might have by talking to it, though there is the obvious risk that ChatGPT makes a technical mistake.  Once you get into real specifics, ChatGPT will start to make mistakes a lot more often or devolve into only saying very general & meaningless things, but before that point, it's quite useful.",
