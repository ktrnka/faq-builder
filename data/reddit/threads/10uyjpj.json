For a university course, I am looking for a unique project idea that involves the application supervised or unsupervised learning. \n\nWe are not allowed to use Kaggle and the project has to be relatively unique. (Can’t be Titanic or Housing Prices as an example)\n\nCould anyone please let me know if they’ve done a project related to sports, finance, or consumer data based on webscraping data or an external dataset outside of Kaggle?\n\nThank you!",
