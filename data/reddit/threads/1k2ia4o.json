    "selftext": "I do marketing for a youth organization. Anytime something out of the ordinary happens, our staff are required to fill out a paper Incident Report. Examples: kid sprains ankle, stolen item, etc. \n\nCurrently the form is completed by hand on paper, then physically signed by both a staff member and the child's parent/guardian. The form is then given to the administrative office to manually input into an Excel doc. \n\nWe want to streamline the process. However, our directors **do not** want the form to be 100% digital as they don't like the optics of parents seeing counselors on phones or tablets.\n\n**The Question:**\n\nIs there a way a handwritten form to be read by an OCR, then be dumped into a Google Sheet, preferably so every written field has its own designated cell? (Or something similar.)\n\nIn my mind, I envision staff uploading images to an Asana Form, have Zapier comb the responses, some type of ORC translate to text, and then have Zapier dump into a Google Sheet. \n\nI have absolutely no background in Machine Learning, etc. Is something like this possible?",
