I'm looking for ideas that could be interesting and manageable as an undergraduate CS student. So far I was thinking of 2 ideas:\n\n1. Â Can cognates fromÂ a related high resource languageÂ be used duringÂ pre training to boost performance on a low resource language model? (I'm also open to any ideas with LRLs).Â \n2. Â Creating a Twitter bot that Â detects climate change misinformation in real time, and then automatically generates concise replies with evidence-based facts.Â \n\nHowever, I'm really open to other ideas in NLP that you guys think would be cool. I would slightly prefer a focus on LRLs because my advisor specializes in that, but I'm open to anything.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, thank you!",

[This blog post](https://research.google/blog/exploring-massively-multilingual-massive-neural-machine-translation/) and its citations have more info, and I'd expect that you could follow citations to find more recent work in the area.\n\nRelated - One of the big challenges in LRL is language classification. Most people use the [fasttext classifiers](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/language-identification.html) which support 176 languages. I wish it supported more languages. And I also wish it supported more variants, like Russian Latin and pinyin",
