    "selftext": "Just as AlphaGo and the StarCraft AI (AlphaStar) made significant contributions to the advancement of reinforcement learning, why not conduct research to develop an AI specifically for defeating World of Warcraft raid bosses?\n\nI believe that achieving significant research outcomes in the interactions of 20 players and real-time decision-making would be possible when tackling WoW raid bosses.\n\nIn particular, rather than training the AI on the patterns of existing raid bosses, it could learn and adapt to new bosses without any prior information, similar to AlphaZero. This approach, especially when new bosses emerge in events like the Race to World First, would be much more challenging and beneficial for the advancement of AI technology compared to previous efforts with AlphaGo or AlphaStar.\n\nHowever, Iâ€™m just a beginner developer who loves World of Warcraft and only has basic knowledge of AI, so I would love to hear the opinions of experts who are well-versed in this field!\n\nIf possible, could it be achievable for the AI to compete in the Race to World First and potentially beat teams like Liquid or Method, just as AlphaGo surpassed professional Go players?",

For AlphaZero on games like Go, it's possibly to do rapid simulation of Go/Chess/etc games. For WoW, you might be able to get some pretraining from publicly available logs. Though last time I worked with WoW logs, those logs didn't have information like positioning. Possibly you could train from live streaming from the video itself, which has at least some position information.\n\nIf you had it learning entirely from playing it'd just be very very expensive.\n\nGetting to your question though, it'd be a good challenge because world-firsts are very much about learning from a small number of data points and machine learning isn't very data-efficient.\n\nFor WoW, I'd start with tools to help with log analysis, maybe ideas like:\n\n* Augmenting logs with additional information (maybe there are addons to do this these days?)\n* Learning some sort of high-level quality metric, maybe from logs on successful boss attempts\n* Explore/exploit suggestions for the raid in terms of behaviors to try",
