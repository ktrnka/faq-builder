Anything with a GPU? Ideally several? If so, turn them into a cluster (K3S works just fine and is a little easier to set up imo depending on your team size) and you'll be able to do everything from downloading data on the cluster to launchig and monitoring training from 'simple' python scripts and even hosting inference apis. To your Data Scientists, it'll be just like having your own Kaggle with a special syntax. It'll be more work to set up, but far cheaper in the long run.\n\nAs someone who did both ML training and serving on bare-metal and cloud, the only way I can see you fit what you describe (Several models going through the entire MLOps lifecycle, potentially at the same time, with active monitoring) is through some form of self-hosting or at least hybrid solution.\n\nCompute power necessary to train models, on the scale you're describing, that alone in the cloud will probably cost you more than your entire budget.

Yet others deal with experimentation and monitoring, like Evidently or Weights&Biases.\n\nThe challenge is integration among all these tools. That's a mindblowingly time consuming task, especially if you need to add in security. For a startup integration is the last thing you want to work on because all the time and money spent on that is not spent on building your product and finding your first customers.\n\nThus my advise is to look for a platform that's integrating all the features you need so you can get started fast and scale it up when your needs grow, e.g. more compute or data. Ideally the platform has storage, data pipelines, model training, deployment and monitoring built-in. This way you don't have to focus on integration different tools first but can get to build your product right away.\n\nTo this end you may like omega-ml, it offers all the features you mention. Can be self hosted and is open core. Several startups have used it to launch successfully. All the core features are part of the open core (Apache license).\n\nhttps://www.omegaml.io/\n\nHope this is useful. Feel free to reach out.\n\nP.S.

Ideally the platform has storage, data pipelines, model training, deployment and monitoring built-in. This way you don&#39;t have to focus on integration different tools first but can get to build your product right away.</p>\n\n<p>To this end you may like omega-ml, it offers all the features you mention. Can be self hosted and is open core. Several startups have used it to launch successfully. All the core features are part of the open core (Apache license).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.omegaml.io/\">https://www.omegaml.io/</a></p>\n\n<p>Hope this is useful. Feel free to reach out.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. I&#39;m the author and I built it because I had the same need.</p>\n</div>",
