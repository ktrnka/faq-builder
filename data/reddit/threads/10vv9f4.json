So it may not be very repeatable if you redo HP tuning, depending on how many you're testing.\n\nIf you're doing k-fold cross-validation on each HP, you might also consider introducing some small random noise between selecting the HP and training so that you get k variations on the HP. Then you can value stability in the results by aggregating with mean - stddev, or something similar.\n\nHope this gives you some ideas! It's not my area of expertise though I've done quite a bit of HP tuning over the years.",
