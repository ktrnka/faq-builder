    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\n  \nI'm a month into a PhD in medical AI, coming from a background in physics. I've trained vision transformers (\\~22M params) on some smaller (\\~90GB) datasets in that time, but admittedly the transition from theoretical physics to ML has not been straightforward. I am clearly missing a ton of community knowledge and experience that my ML colleagues have. I have managed to get things working so far by wrestling my code into a Frankensteinesque blend of my own math and GPT+Claude's contributions, but I'm moving too slow this way and am never more than hopeful there are no silent bugs. I wanted to ask the community for resources and tips on writing clean ML code, ML best practices, etc. All the stuff that slows you down but makes your life easier in the long term. Any help is very appreciated!",

      "body": "Welcome! I'll give you some of the tips I wish someone had given me in my PhD:\n\n- Whenever possible, break off small bits of code that have a bunch of if statements and write a unit test for them\n- Get into an alternating development cadence of creating new things and cleaning things up. It could be as simple as 1 day of code quality improvement for every 3 days of adding code\n- More generally, spend a percentage of your time on efforts that accelerate your future (learning, deliberate practice, seeking out advice)\n- Seek out feedback on your code or your overall design. When someone doesn't like your code, try not to fixate on the literal criticism, but seek out the underlying issue\n- Find books/videos/articles in software engineering best practices. The underlying principles still apply to ML code, but the challenges we face in ML are sometimes subtly different. If you have extra time, find peer reviewed literature on code quality\n- If you're not to the level that you want to be, don't stress about that so long as you're making a little progress every week\n\nThat said, I did CS for undergrad so I faced different challenges. Feel free to ask follow ups if it would help. I also worked in medical AI for a while and I'm happy to help there if you have any questions (though in NLP not vision)",
