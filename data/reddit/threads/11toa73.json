      "body": "If you're just looking to label diseases mentioned in the notes, I'd suggest scispacy. We found that worked fairly well for entity extraction on clinical notes. Here are a couple of blog posts:\n\n[https://medium.com/@MansiKukreja/clinical-text-negation-handling-using-negspacy-and-scispacy-233ce69ab2ac](https://medium.com/@MansiKukreja/clinical-text-negation-handling-using-negspacy-and-scispacy-233ce69ab2ac)\n\n[https://www.andrewvillazon.com/clinical-natural-language-processing-python/](https://www.andrewvillazon.com/clinical-natural-language-processing-python/)\n\nI *think* scispacy doesn't come with anything out of the box to link to resolve entities to ICD10, Snomed, etc, but I forget. We looked into some but they were very basic, just doing substring searches rather than a fuzzy match.\n\nAlternatively, you might try [Amazon Comprehend Medical](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/). It's going to be more work to setup and may be pricey depending on your data, but it's also more full featured. We found it worked well on notes (but poorly on what we really needed -- patient-doctor chat).\n\nIf you're more interested in research, I'd suggest searching for MIMIC III in ACL/EMNLP/ML4H and related conferences. That'll at least get you the older work that does this sort of thing, then you can find more recent work from the citation graph. Keep in mind that MIMIC III is a certain kind of healthcare data though, so an ICD10 classifier from it may not transfer to the healthcare specialty you need.\n\nHope this helps! I spent the last 6 yr working in ML for primary care telemedicine. Largely we predicted ICD10 from patient input with our internal data, so we had an easier time with it.",
