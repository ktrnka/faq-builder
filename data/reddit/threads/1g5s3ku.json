Your ignorance is not a barrier provided that you can muster earnest curiosity. Think of a 5 year old repeatedly asking \"why\" about something; if you have enough curiosity then you can probe what they've done on theur resume to considerable depth. It's okay if you don't fully understand the answers: you can ask them to explain further.\n\nThis kind of questioning is also valuablev in talking with them about the actual work that you're doing at your company and which you'll want them to help with. Its basically just an actual discussion that you might have with them as a coworker, with you trying to use their experience to your benefit. Not only will this help you evaluate competency, it will also give you a sense if they have adequate interpersonal skills. \n\nThat last thing is the most important one IMO. If given a choice between a genius with poor interpersonal skills, and someone strictly average with good interpersonal skills, you should choose the second one every time with no hesitation.",

You could probably ask a well-respected manager in another area to interview on mentorship. Like bregav said, interpersonal skills > technical skills.\n\nI like to ask people about projects they've done in the past because it's very grounded in reality and it's more interesting. That said, the downside is that it's tougher to compare candidates until you're experienced at that type of interview.\n\nIf you want to use a systems design interview, I'd recommend the systems design equivalent of fizzbuzz. The goal would be to quickly weed out people that are blatantly lying about their skills. Then you could talk about another topic afterwards. Keep in mind that this would just weed out blatantly bad candidates and probably won't give a reliable signal on the difference between any reasonable candidates.\n\nAlso keep in mind, you can't prevent all bad hires. The steps in the hiring pipeline are just improving the odds of finding a good hire and decreasing the odds of a bad hire.",
