Is it modularized and usable by everyone on your team? Can it be automated?\n\n3. If feature engineering is required for a model, do you do it manually or automated? Can the features be used for other similar models? If yes, can we store it somewhere?\n\n4. As for model training and optimizations - can it be an offline job? No one is going to stare at the notebook locally and have it run overnight.\n\n5. How do u know if your latest model is better than your previous ones? Can we consider a Champion vs Challenger workflow? Can we have some BI tools to log all these metrics (Loss/ROC/Accuracy etc) ?\n\n6. Can we have some sort of alert systems notifying the team if trainings pipelines failed or succeed ?\n\n7. Who is using the latest model? Internal or external parties? How should you deliver  model predictions - will it be an offline job with an excel file or the users will talk with your model via an API?\n\n8. If an API is required, what tools, language and framework will you use and how do you update your model checkpoints automatically without interfering production models ?\n\n9.

Tuning hyper parameters and trying different model architectures is easy, if you have new data you can optimize those things in a matter of days or a week or two. What I find happens is you'll hit a threshold that's not good enough for the business need, and no matter what hyper parameters or model architecture you use, you can't break past it. At that point the only feasible way to get improvement is to try different approaches with capturing and calculating features, transforming them, etc. There is no Kaggle dataset or predefined project that even comes close to replicating this process.\n\nI have worked on 5 ML models that have been deployed to production, from the stage of raw data to continuous monitoring in production.
