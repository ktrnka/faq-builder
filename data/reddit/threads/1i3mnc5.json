If I were that patient I'd feel bad seeing my identifiers out there. Also dates of care are [HIPAA identifiers](https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/dataandstats/data/Pages/ListofHIPAAIdentifiers.aspx).\n\n\n\nIf I were building this today, I'd use an LLM to generate clinical notes from transcripts. I'd start with a basic LLM with some prompt engineering and then fine-tune it from corrected notes once I had enough usage data. If it were at my last healthtech job, I'd look into AWS Bedrock because we were an AWS shop and it's HIPAA eligible. (Though of course I would do deeper dive with our legal team before sending ANY patient data through it)\n\nSome of the challenges I'm aware of, and suggest thinking about:\n\n- This is an area where it's unacceptable to hallucinate. If possible, borrow approaches from extractive summarization whether in an LLM or another approach\n- How much does it need to be customized per doctor, per specialty, or per medical group? Each doctor tends to want slightly different things, and each specialty tends to have different conventions\n- Developing robust metrics is very hard for this. A basic metric would be how much do doctors edit the resulting note. However, some doctors won't bother updating, or may not update on busy days. So the signal is noisy. And unfortunately, editing may stop once it's good enough. Ideally though, you want metrics that are more objective like the effect of your clinical notes on health outcomes. For example, if you can reduce hospital readmissions that'd be a good one. Or reduce adverse outcomes from medications.\n- If it's the kind of practice in which patients have access to clinical notes, that may affect the desired output.\n\nI don't have the answers on all these things. I brain dumped to emphasize that it's important to try and deeply understand WHY and HOW doctors use clinical notes, and the role those clinical notes play in the practice of medicine. If you deeply understand both the medical needs and the technology involved, it's possible to improve both clinical efficiency and outcomes, but oftentimes people unintentionally sacrifice one for the other.\n\n\nFor content, I led the machine learning team at a telemedicine startup for years. We explored automated clinical notes but the tech wasn't reliable enough back then. I think it's ready today so long as you're careful.\n\nI'd also suggest doing a literature review, particularly of startups in this area. The ones I know of are Abridge, Nabla, and Rad.ai.",

Examples include OpenAI, Google Cloud, Azure, AWS, Anthropic, Perplexity, and so on. If their LLM APIs are HIPAA compliant they should have a page clearly stating that they are. In the case of AWS they describe things as \"HIPAA eligible\" which I interpret as \"HIPAA compliant if it's configured properly\"\n\nYour goal here is to filter the list down and save time when working with your legal/IT/finance teams. It's not enough that the vendor encrypts their data and says HIPAA on their website. They also need to sign a legal document called a business associate agreement (BAA). I don't know too much of the details but I believe that document is partly about acknowledging HIPAA/security and liability for data breaches. In an industry setting, that agreement would be between your employer and AWS/OpenAI/etc. That's another reason why it's often good to use an existing vendor: If you already have a BAA with AWS, typically it covers all AWS services so no new paperwork is needed. All the major cloud players (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) will do BAAs. I haven't looked into LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, etc.\n\n\n\nIf you're building out a proof of concept that you're hoping to ship to production, I'd suggest doing basic diligence to ensure that your LLM and TTS providers can meet your HIPAA/security needs and then building out your proof of concept without real patient data. Just do something like fake doctor's visits over Zoom or an equivalent and record those. When doing fake doctor's visits, you can read up a little about patient acting/simulated patients and do the visit with a real doctor if they have the time. Then once you have the audio and associated clinical notes, you can work on the TTS part and/or LLM part. \n\nIf I were doing it today, I'd start with a simpler task without as many legal concerns. Something like recording meetings and generating meeting notes. Most of the same basic skills in TTS and LLMs will be utilized for those. The goal would be to develop my skills sufficiently before starting to use lots of time from doctors. There may even be standardized academic datasets and papers in that area that could be used.\n\nLong story short: I'd develop my skills and prototype in a non-HIPAA situation first, and only once I'm confident would I start working with real patient data that requires HIPAA. When working with non-HIPAA data, you can speed up by using APIs for most things. Then later on you can find a HIPAA-compliant version of each component, whether that's still an API or whether you need to self-host something.\n\n  \nAlso while it's top of mind, be sure to put thought into the UX of the microphones and how you're going to get reliable, high-quality audio data from all of your doctors. That's one of the hardest parts of all this.",
