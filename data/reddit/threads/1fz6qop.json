      "body": "I've used scikit-learn in a lot of professional situations, for example:\n\n* Classifying text + tabular data from patients in a healthcare setting into a variety of classes, ranging from what additional information is needed from the patient, to the urgency of the issue, to whether prescriptions are likely needed, to the most likely diagnosis. Some of those were used in production features and we upgraded to better neural networks in Pytorch.\n* Classifying tabular data to identify spammers\n* Low-effort regression analysis: I find it much faster and easier to use linear regression in sklearn compared to say GLM in a statistical package because it's easier in sklearn to package up all the feature preprocessing. I've done this mainly in the medical space. A good example would be a question like \"What is the partial effect of the doctor on the duration of the visit, controlling for the diagnosis category, whether a prescription was needed, the age of the patient, etc?\"\n* Classifying pairs of players in an online game to predict whether they're likely to become friends based on tabular data of their interaction history\n* Using sklearn classification models plus eli5 or another wrapper to figure out which words and phrases best explain positive vs negative reviews\n\nIn many cases, I've used sklearn as a place to start, then I see if I can build a compelling feature/product that delivers value to users, and if it does then I look into other approaches to improve quality. I find that sklearn is very good at the early stages of feature development because I can iterate quickly.\n\nI should also mention that doing a rapid prototype with sklearn is very helpful to understand my needs around data quality and volume.\n\nI'm probably forgetting some projects but hopefully that gives some sense of things!",
