Some of the things I'd try:\n\n* Bag of ngrams: This is likely to help if there are topics it mixes up and you have enough data to get reliable data\n* Use standard methods to extract the main text of the webpage and only use that for your classifier\n* Separate bag of words/ngrams for the main body of the page vs the title vs meta tags\n* Bag of ngrams for the URL: Depending on how you tokenize it, you might need 3grams or more. Alternatively you could manually split on slashes and take various prefixes then one-hot encode them like words/ngrams\n* What domains does the page link to?\n\nIf you're looking to learn that's what I'd suggest.\n\nIf instead the accuracy is the most important, you might try fine-tuning BERT or a BERT-variant. That can offer better quality because it already has reliable embeddings for most words and phrases.\n\nGood luck!",
