I did utilize TensorFlow and modify the scoring criteria for a neural network to better fit my desired outcome, but the results ended up being worse than I expected / got from out-of-the-box Scikit-Learn (mostly Random Forest and Logistic Regression).\n\n*edit: Worth noting, I have had a LOT of success with the ML for sports betting, but talking about gambling in an interview is always tough.*\n\nI'm trying to come up with projects to bolster my resume to transition into data science, but struggling to find something that will properly teach me more of the foundational science behind it, while also being a strong/impressive enough talking point that I could add it to my resume.\n\nAny suggestions?",

You first arrange a matrix X for which each row represents individual samples, and each column a unique feature; i.e., row one would contain x\\^2, x, and 1, representing each degree feature plus an offset term which represents c. You then construct matrix A which are your coefficients a, b, and c. Finally, you set AX = Y, where Y is a vector of outputs, ordered such that the rows of Y are the solution to the corresponding row in X.
