    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am currently a college student trying to learn more about machine learning. I want to do the part that involves data analysis, statistics, and mathematical modelling, rather than creating the software needed to train and deploy models. Basically, more investigative work and research. I am ok with creating data pipelines and data visualizations, but I don't want programming, like API calling, distributed systems, deployment, backend/frontend etc, to be the focus of my work if that makes sense.\n\nMy current understanding is that this leans more on the side of data science rather than machine learning engineering (which I heard is basically a software engineering role that involves machine learning). Please let me know if this is the correct interpretation, and I would greatly appreciate any advice for this career path. I am currently pursuing an Industrial Engineering degree with a CS minor and plan to get a concurrent MS in CS.\n\nThanks!",

I plan to write \"Industrial Engineering and Computer Science\" on my resume for my bachelors section, and \"Computer Science\" for masters. I will have relevant experiences for data science/ML, though, I just prefer the curriculum for IE over CS for bachelors.",
