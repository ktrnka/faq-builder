What are some common or important metrics or criterias that they use to evaluate your work? How do they vary depending on the industry, company size or culture?\n\nFor example, do they look at how much you improve model performance by x%, reduce error rate by y%, increase customer satisfaction by z%, or something else? How do they give you feedback and recognition for your work?\n\nI would apreciate any insights or experiences that you can share. Thank you!",

There are often 3-10 executive-level metrics and they assign people to maintain them.\n\nFor example, at my previous company we had top-level metrics such as cost per visit, revenue per visit, net promoter score from patients, contract renewal rate, service availability percentage, and many others. \n\nService availability was calculated monthly or so by engineering leadership or the systems engineering team. Largely they looked at AWS and Tableau dashboards to calculate it.\n\nRevenue per visit was calculated by finance. They were already tracking revenue, and just needed to pull the number of visits from Tableau.\n\nCost per visit was calculated similarly, but there's a lot of complexity in what costs count. But again that was finance.\n\nThe hardest part of assessment is attribution. Someone might deliver a project that seemed to save our doctors time, and I tried to take those estimates and convert them to financials the best I could. Like say one project was projected to save $5mil over the next 2 years, or another $100k, another $10k etc.\n\nOther projects like feature requests for customers were much tougher. Like say if we hadn't built some feature a customer asked for... would they have not signed the contract with us? Or were they just bluffing to get more work? My team didn't work so much in that area so I didn't have a process for dealing with that",
