You *might* be able to overcome that if you build a way for contributors to quickly and easily see the impact of their effort.

On the other hand, if the system re-writes their content without attribution, contributors may find that demotivating.\n\nAn alternative approach would be to build a subreddit or Discord for this kind of content and focus on the community-building aspect of it. That way contributors are getting immediate value (connection, answers, belonging, validation, etc) while building the data you want for this.\n\nIn short: Getting the volume of data is the hard part.
