How do we restore service? How do we figure out what went wrong? How/should we prevent this in the future?\n\nThere are several different types of \"something went wrong\" that could be useful: Maybe the predictions are much worse and our users complained. Maybe the container is OOM and crashlooping. Maybe latency increased above the timeout for something calling our service. Maybe someone messed with auth. If you have examples from your startup that'd be even better.\n\nI say this because I find many people focus too much on the tools and too little on what we're actually trying to accomplish with MLOps practices.",

MLOps is what we are looking for then !\n\nI might be wrong here but on a start-up environment, say a team of 3-4 person where obviously a same person needs to handle different type of tasks, what you described as MLE is very close to what a DS would do ? Or it is atleast close to what our DS are currently doing right now.",
