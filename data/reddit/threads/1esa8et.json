      "body": "You're really just asking what AI means, nothing to do with inference. You're using the word \"infer\" to just mean map inputs to outputs. \"Infer\" usually carries other meaning, but since, again, it seems like you're mostly just interested in what \"AI\" means, I'll put the word \"infer\" aside and focus on what your question seems to be.\n\nAnd the answer is that there kind of isn't one. There's many different definitions and people rarely mean something precise when they use the term. Personally, and within my team, I use the word AI to mean a certain type of \"advanced algorithm\". I don't necessarily even try to be precise. But it's vague, and it encapsulates things like expert systems and probabilistic inference as well as, most notably, machine learning. There's a certain degree of \"generality\" to AI-based algorithms IMO, but I haven't thought super hard about how it should fit into the definition. In this higher level/umbrella type of definition, I see online a lot that words like \"autonomous\" or \"human-like\" are used. I disagree with those. But again, there is no single good definition here.\n\nAlso, I acknowledge that there's plenty of other uses of the term AI, and they have all evolved over time. Some people use AI to mean ML (which I define roughly as fitting models to data and making predictions, etc.). Some people use AI to mean DL. Some people use AI to mean generative DL. Some people use AI to mean LLMs. Yada yada. Often times it seems like AI is just \"whatever the most advanced thing we can do right now\".\n\nIME, \"AI\" is mostly used as a marketing term. When I talk to other technical people, I never use the term.",
