This was in the medical space, which doesn't have a lot of freely available labeled or unlabeled data.\n\nWe wanted to ask a patient \"What brings you here today? Please describe your symptoms in 2-3 sentences.\", then we'd predict many things based on their answer. For example, we might predict whether the doctor would want a photo of the affected area and if so, ask the patient for a photo.\n\nAt the time, we almost no data from our virtual clinic. So we crowdsourced the unlabeled data on Mechanical Turk, asking people to imagine going to the doctor and answering that question. That got us the unlabeled dataset. We also explored web scraping some alternative sources but I don't remember if any were good quality.\n\nThen we built an internal annotation form connected to that unlabeled data. It would show the unlabeled data, then the medical professional could click a checkbox for whether a photo was needed (and another 100 or so categories and questions-to-ask). The annotation platform we used was renamed/acquired a couple of times and I lost track after they were acquired by Appen. We found we weren't annotating quickly enough with our own doctors so we hired a group of nurses as contractors to do annotation.\n\nSpecific challenges:\n\n* The unlabeled data wasn't a perfect proxy for real data, though it was surprisingly close. A good example of data that was missing was stuff like \"I have a cold\" or \"I have a UTI\". We had instructed the turkers to describe symptoms and they generally followed the directions (more carefully than our actual patients did!). Similarly, turkers tended to under-represent mental health conditions compared to our actual patient population.\n* The labeling process was somewhat slow so we spent a month or two optimizing the user interface of the form and finding a way to inject more dynamic layouts. This helped to improve speed of annotation and also consistency.\n* Initially there was a lot of manual overhead for things like tracking hours worked by the annotators, creating new jobs to do, sending notifications to annotators, etc. We automated parts of that over time. If I remember correctly, the platform we used didn't support our style of private annotation pool very well so we had to build tools to help manage that.\n* We later tried to do HIPAA-compliant annotation inside of their platform, which they claimed to support. After working with them for months, I believe we decided that their solution would not meet our privacy and security goals.\n\nBig-picture challenges:\n\n* Annotator agreement was a challenge for certain labels. We revised the labels over time and also revised our annotation guidelines over time, but that could only take things so far.\n* We also added labels over time, but we weren't set up to re-annotate the old data just for the new labels. Instead we adjusted the way we trained our models to allow for missing labels.\n* It was tough to put a dollar value on each additional annotation. I believe we stopped annotation around the time that the number of labels plateaued, and the F1 scores were plateauing, and also we were starting to get real data.\n\nIf I had to do it again, I'd try Sagemaker Label Studio for the medical annotation part. We were an AWS shop so it would've simplified billing, and I believe it could do both private workforces as well as HIPAA compliance if we wanted to annotate our real medical data.\n\nHappy to answer any questions, though keep in mind it was 7 years ago so I may not remember all the details.\n\n  \nEdit: One more challenge we faced (which I'd do differently now) was about providing consistent work and income for our nurses (annotators). They were more used to predictable work, like gigs with a guaranteed 10 hours per week. We also have times when we needed to drastically increase or decrease our annotation but that came into conflict with the need for predictable work. Towards the end of the annotation project we were much better about providing predictable income and I wish I'd understood that at the start of the project.",

      "body": "Part 2: \n\n\\> optimizing the user interface\n\nSome of it was simple, like getting rid of the scroll box inside of a scroll box that came from the default settings. Another simple one was showing some basic tracking about the annotator's session, like I think how many they'd done or how long they'd worked for.\n\nThe one major UI change I remember was organizing most of the labels by the body system and having expand/collapse groups for those labels. That came about because we scaled our labels from about 30 or so to about 150 and it was tough to navigate a full 150. I vaguely remember doing something dynamic as well, like if they tagged it as a dermatology issue I think we somehow highlighted the group of skin-related labels.\n\nI think we also provided a counter of how many questions they wanted to ask, because we found that one source of disagreement was that some annotators wanted to ask a small number of questions (5-10) and others would want like 30 questions answered. I'm pretty sure we had it turn red if they picked too few or too many, and green if it was in a decent range. If I were doing this today I might explore this as a ranking problem (which questions are most valuable to ask) or to limit them to 10 questions. It just would've been tricky to do that and also have quick annotation speed.\n\nAnother example was weaving annotation guidelines into the UI when possible, either with smaller-font directions below it or a question mark they could hover or click to get more info. The one I remember was triage. Initially the label was simplistic \"Is this an urgent case?\". We found that there wasn't good agreement on that label, and added directions like \"By urgent, we mean that this patient should skip to the front of the queue if they would need to wait 30 minutes or more\" or some such. That was helpful but not helpful enough and our clinic didn't actually need any automated triage until 2020 when we got overwhelmed in the early pandemic.\n\n\\> HIPAA compliance with the annotation platforms\n\nIn general with US health data, you need to make sure it's all encrypted in transit and at rest. You need to have strict permissions about who can access it. And you may need to have a legal agreement with any companies that are processing the data.\n\nThe platform we tried to use didn't meet those requirements, but they said another medical company had done a secure alternative so we explored it. What they suggested: The annotation form would still run from their servers, and we'd set it to include an iframe or javascript to request our sensitive medical data on our servers to show to the users. We were expected to have those URLs to medical data only work within our network.\n\nThat solution had the following fundamental issues (aside from any documentation issues):\n\n* Any Javascript libraries their site runs would have access to our sensitive medical data, so if they did Javascript metrics or logging in certain ways it would effectively cause a data breach. Likewise, if any of their Javascript libraries were hacked the attacker could then gain access to our medical data. There wasn't a good way to ensure trust of all Javascript libraries they used across every update.\n* Network restrictions is not really sufficient for privacy and security in this situation. After all, when accessing our databases we not just restricted to the network but also required individual credentials. And not everyone in the company even had credentials for sensitive medical data. Having it open on our network was a loosening of security that we didn't want.\n\nThe goal of HIPAA-compliant annotation would've been to enable annotation on our clinic's medical data. For instance, when we revisited the triage problem in 2020 we did that with real medical data. In 2020, I believe we just used Google Sheets with a few of our doctors to quickly try out different approaches, and that was good enough for a small scale of data. (We had a BAA with Google for GSuite)\n\n\\> balance the fluctuating workload with their need for predictable hours?\n\nTowards the end of the annotation project, I think our batches of annotation were mainly motivated by 1) identifying a category of patient issue that didn't have good data, sourcing that unlabeled data, then labeling and 2) adding new labels.\n\nI think we settled on guaranteed minimum hours of work per week, which sometimes meant that we'd solicit annotation of a generic batch even though our models were really plateauing. I'm sure the extra annotation helped a bit, but it was definitely less valuable than many of the other batches.",

That was helpful but not helpful enough and our clinic didn&#39;t actually need any automated triage until 2020 when we got overwhelmed in the early pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>&gt; HIPAA compliance with the annotation platforms</p>\n\n<p>In general with US health data, you need to make sure it&#39;s all encrypted in transit and at rest. You need to have strict permissions about who can access it. And you may need to have a legal agreement with any companies that are processing the data.</p>\n\n<p>The platform we tried to use didn&#39;t meet those requirements, but they said another medical company had done a secure alternative so we explored it. What they suggested: The annotation form would still run from their servers, and we&#39;d set it to include an iframe or javascript to request our sensitive medical data on our servers to show to the users. We were expected to have those URLs to medical data only work within our network.</p>\n\n<p>That solution had the following fundamental issues (aside from any documentation issues):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Any Javascript libraries their site runs would have access to our sensitive medical data, so if they did Javascript metrics or logging in certain ways it would effectively cause a data breach. Likewise, if any of their Javascript libraries were hacked the attacker could then gain access to our medical data. There wasn&#39;t a good way to ensure trust of all Javascript libraries they used across every update.</li>\n<li>Network restrictions is not really sufficient for privacy and security in this situation. After all, when accessing our databases we not just restricted to the network but also required individual credentials. And not everyone in the company even had credentials for sensitive medical data. Having it open on our network was a loosening of security that we didn&#39;t want.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The goal of HIPAA-compliant annotation would&#39;ve been to enable annotation on our clinic&#39;s medical data. For instance, when we revisited the triage problem in 2020 we did that with real medical data. In 2020, I believe we just used Google Sheets with a few of our doctors to quickly try out different approaches, and that was good enough for a small scale of data. (We had a BAA with Google for GSuite)</p>\n\n<p>&gt; balance the fluctuating workload with their need for predictable hours?</p>\n\n<p>Towards the end of the annotation project, I think our batches of annotation were mainly motivated by 1) identifying a category of patient issue that didn&#39;t have good data, sourcing that unlabeled data, then labeling and 2) adding new labels.</p>\n\n<p>I think we settled on guaranteed minimum hours of work per week, which sometimes meant that we&#39;d solicit annotation of a generic batch even though our models were really plateauing. I&#39;m sure the extra annotation helped a bit, but it was definitely less valuable than many of the other batches.</p>\n</div>",
