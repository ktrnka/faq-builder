      "body": "If you're talking about energy efficiency, I don't think it'd be that interesting with cancer diagnosis. It's well worth the energy costs for any models I've seen in this space.\n\nIf you're talking about compute efficiency, it'd help to have an example of the importance. For instance I bet some applications would need very low latency.\n\nIf you're talking about the kind of efficiency for low-power devices, that might be interesting. There might be some interesting applications with portable devices around hospitals.\n\nThere could be a lot of interesting work on data efficiency, which is highly relevant for medical diagnosis because there's such a shortage of public medical data. Furthermore, different diagnoses have uneven amounts of data; you might have 1000x more bronchitis data than lung cancer data. Oftentimes ML models for Dx do the worst at rare diagnoses, which is where we really need quality the most.\n\nCross-dataset is really interesting and a big issue with medical machine learning; the input data isn't the same across different hospitals/etc. I don't know ICD codes for lung cancer very well, but there could be variations in how those are used as well (for instance if some medical groups are very specific about location in the ICD coeds and others are not)\n\nJust some ideas though! Medical ML is a very interesting, challenging, and promising area of work",
