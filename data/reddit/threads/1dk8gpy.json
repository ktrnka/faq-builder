The problem here is a lot of the words are so ambiguous and can mean very different things in different contexts. I can train a model to differentiate the meaning in each case.

Unfortunately, the knowledge required to appropriately unpack the response is quite high, a lot of it goes over my head. Admittedly, I am not very experienced in prompt engineering. I have spoken to the team and we've agreed to split the responsibility of labelling data to fine tune a model for what we want. Again, that takes a fair amount of time.\n\nI have used tf idf, clustering and topic modelling to compare the words/groups/topics between negative and positive for particular categories. \n\nNow looking to use dependency parsing and POS tagging to figure out what action words are associated with respective categories.
