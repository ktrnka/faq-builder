      "body": "Nothing has worked consistently for me. The most consistent thing has been a pile of papers on my desk. Here are some of the things I've tried that haven't worked too well:\n\n- For short-term things I keep a Google Drive folder with the things I want to print. I try to name the folders by date or event, like \"2024\\_12\" or \"2024\\_NAACL\". That helps if I want to read a paper on my phone at a coffee shop, or if I want to print one out at the library. Though the reading experience on mobile isn't great because it doesn't save my position in the pdf.\n- I use Chrome bookmarks for a lot of papers and periodically organize them. The problem is that my reading list grows faster than I can read the papers. And also Chrome's bookmark manager isn't great for this.\n- For a few years I used Mendeley, but I found that the software was pretty flaky.\n- For a year or two I tried Zotero. That was better than Mendeley and I was good about using it for work-related papers. I wasn't good about using it for side project papers. When I was at my most diligent, I'd take notes in Zotero in markdown and would copy/paste them into Slack to share to the relevant people\n\nIf you find something that works for you, please share!",

Usually professors are careful to recommend papers that are important to learn and also easier to read, so that can help.\n\nIf you prefer reading groups, it's best if you can find a group of people that will hold each other accountable. That could be a local meetup or a group of people at work/school.\n\nI'm not sure exactly what part is toughest for you so I'll give advice in a range of areas, and let me know if there's some aspect of starting to read that you find most challenging:\n\n* Building the habit is hard. Set a very low goal to develop the habit, something like reading one page per day (of any technical material). Some papers you'll find interesting and you'll read more. Other days you'll stop at one page.\n* If you're struggling with terminology or references to other concepts, pause your reading of that paper and learn those terms or concepts. ChatGPT is great for that because you can ask a lot of questions.\n* In my experience, older foundational papers tend to be easier to read. So one approach is to use tools like Google Scholar or Connected Papers and trace back from a recent paper to older work, then read some of the highly cited papers in chronological order.\n* Some people learn faster from books rather than papers, especially in well-established areas. Others learn better from lectures. Others learn better from tutorials or projects. If one approach isn't working for you, mix it up and try another for a time.",
