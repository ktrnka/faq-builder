For example, when the AI reads \"salmon\", it puts it into the Meat category. When it reads \"Swiss\" it puts it into the Dairy category. When it reads \"whisk\" it puts it in to the Cooking Utensils category as well as the Cooking Method category. And when it is done with the article, it returns all of the words and all of the categories that they fall into. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestions: \n\n1.

So how could deep q learning possibly work with this if the neural networks for it have a rigid structure and therefore would not be able to accommodate this? If I were to create the neural network with 9 outputs, towards the end of the game it would start spitting out illegal moves if it gave the highest Q-value to a move that isn't possible and so it wouldn't work.

Now, if your function is very weird, for instance discrete/discontinuous, this might not matter.
