      "body": "Perhaps a better way to think about unsupervised learning is this: you're given a complex input space, but you think there's patterns in there you can find. If you can find these patterns, it reduces the complexity of the input space. The question becomes what kinds of patterns do you think you have (the objective), and how will you uncover them (the model). This can actually be extended to supervised learning: the kinds of patterns are those that effectively map to the output space with higher accuracy, and how you uncover them is by assuming a neural network can uncover the patterns effectively, for example. So then what is the output of unsupervised learning? It's simply a different way of looking at (representing) the data, depending on what your assumptions were (for example, in K-means you assume the data can be clustered according to a set of centroids; in self-supervised learning, you don't necessarily know what the patterns are, but you know some properties about the data that can be helpful).",
