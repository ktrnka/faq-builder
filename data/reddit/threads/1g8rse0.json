My question would be which evaluation metrics to use? Knowing that I don't have access to the model that the app is based on.\n\n  \nI don't really know anything about AI or ML but willing to learn. The idea would be to collect images of skin lesions during a free consult and run them through the app for the most probable diagnosis (I've attached a screenshot of how the reports look there), with a second opinion from a trained dermatologist to see how often the app got the diagnosis right.\n\n  \nI hope this is making sense. Any advice is welcome! Thanks and great day to you all.",

Here are some things to keep in mind with that approach:\n\n* The quality of results may be affected by things such as the model you pick in the app, the quality of the photo, the type of diagnosis, and the skin tone of the patient. I'd recommend logging all those things so that you can later analyze what had the most effect on quality. Another option would be to try out the different settings in the app and try out a couple photo options to find what seems to work best before you use that with many patients.\n* Medical professionals can sometimes be influenced by models if they see the model output before they look at the patient, so I'd recommend showing the images to the dermatologist first before having them assess the app's output.\n* You might find that the app often labels things as dermatitis, which is probably true but might not be very useful. I'd suggest having some sort of measurement related to how useful the diagnosis is. For example, you could judge whether the diagnosis is specific enough to recommend the correct treatment.\n\nHope this helps!",
