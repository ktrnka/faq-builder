That’s when we decided to take matters into our own hands and developed what you might recognize as a precursor to Kitops. Check it out at [https://kitops.ml/](https://kitops.ml/).\n\n**Kitops** is an open-source CLI tool and an OCI (Open Container Initiative) artifact called **ModelKits**—think Docker images but tailored for your machine learning needs. Here’s why it might just be the sanity saver you’re searching for:\n\n1. **Comprehensive Bundling**: ModelKits can package models, data, configurations, and documentation all in one place. No more hunting through separate repositories to find compatible data-model pairs. It’s like having a neatly organized toolbox instead of a junk drawer.\n\n2. **OCI Compatibility**: Since ModelKits adhere to OCI standards, they can be stored in any OCI-compliant registry like Artifactory or DockerHub. This ensures seamless integration with both your on-premise and cloud infrastructures without reinventing the wheel.\n\n3. **Version Control**: Every ModelKit is versioned, allowing you to track changes and roll back to previous versions effortlessly. This tight coupling of data and model versions ensures consistency and reproducibility.\n\n4. **Security and Auditing**: Leveraging OCI standards means you inherit robust security features and auditing capabilities already present in your registries. Your rapid sprints can continue without compromising on compliance or security.\n\n5. **Ease of Adoption**: If your workflows already interact with OCI registries, integrating Kitops is a breeze. It aligns with your existing processes, reducing the learning curve and speeding up deployment times.\n\nIn essence, Kitops streamlines the chaos by providing a unified, versioned, and secure way to manage your models and data across hybrid infrastructures.\n\nGive Kitops a try and see if it can restore some order to your data-driven madness. And hey, if you hit any snags or just want to swap war stories, feel free to ping me here or join the Kitops open-source community discussions.",

DVC creates the pipelines and at the modeling stage I register the model at Mlflow.\n\nBut since you have data coming daily, I would suggest you to look at mage.ai solution. It creates a pipeline as well, but it already has a streaming solution, so for every event it triggers an action that you created. So you can combine mage with Mlflow to manage you data and models.
