    "selftext": "I've finally finished the backward pass on a very complicated pipeline. It's probably my 6th or 7th iteration on an idea that I started working on after I got laid off 4 months ago. \n\nAfter a couple of months I had some success with the general concept with a lighter version of what I have now. What I'm working on is different from anything that I've ever seen before. The whole premise and foundation is totally different. I'm building off of Bert but then it takes a wild turn, hopefully it will eventually land and be grounded on WordNet and FrameNet... IF it works lol\n\nI've been working in a bubble, and that's how the model has become so weird. All of the ideas I've been using have been without editing from trained humans. I see that as a strength but overall, I see it as a huge weakness and a chance for insanity.\n\nI guess my question, if you're still reading, how can I emotionally deal with the question of releasing my code? Part of me feels intensely territorial about the thing that I've built because it's so unique. The other part of me realizes that any criticism would shatter this house of cards I've built for myself. The final part of myself needs a f****** job lol \n\nSo, do you release all your code? I realize how hypocritical it is to pilfer concepts and code from around the internet, customize it, then think you made it when really 80% of was somebody else's work. The plumbing is unique but the structure was created by others.\n\nInsecurity is really fueling this territoriality. I started learning ml when I got laid off. The big fear is that someone more competent will be able to run with this idea and my chance to do something meaningful will have vanished.",
