      "body": "Oh sure. I'm in the first year of my PhD and I've pretty much done the same. Followed a few of my interests and let that decide what I can do, what I need to learn in order to do what I can't yet, and find some publication grounds in the intermediate time along this learning and investigation curve. It's an iterative process where you slowly figure out an intersection of what keeps you working late hours trying to contribute to the field, and what you're good at.\n\nAnd since LLM tech is booming right now with most people not really having a strong feeling of why what works and why something doesn't (the bounds of the tech), I think it's a great time to contribute to the field, but also completely standard to be overwhelmed by it. Adressing explainability makes a lot of sense, but if you go for annotation studies, it'd be a pain in the arse. If you're going with LVMs without having too much background in this, expect to spend quite some time in learning how to integrate modalities, build graphs or representations, and figuring out reproducible usage of GPU clusters or something.\n\nOf course my supervisor would have me figure out and have a topic from day 1, but I'm glad she's patient and supportive. It's difficult if your interests sometimes go a bit further away from your supervisors expertise, but a good mentor always figures out collabs and joint supervisions.\n\nAs for staying in academia vs going to the industry, my take on it is that if you wanna streamline a process or work with lots and lots of use cases in a limited domain, go to industry. If you wanna explore more and find out what you're good at and have more time to understand what's happening, stay in academia. Of course, there are overlaps to both. Universities have partnerships with institutes and companies and do investigative projects for them, or do their own development. Industries also have research tracks where you're publishing quite a bit along with being an expert consultant for products. I'm probably trying to do this after finishing my PhD. \n\nOh and of course, you love money, go to the industry. An AGI would probably maximise some universal basic resources like money and Internet access, so trying to get a bunch of money to not worry about where you're gonna live in the next 30 years and not giving it all away in the form of rent is a totally legit thing.\n\nFeel free to ask if I missed something. Not to mention, if you're interested in any specific project and would like to collaborate, I'm happy to join if there's an overlap. Cheers!! :D",

Again, not a comprehensive overview, but that's kinda the thing. And this can see applications in say some labs where you work with a hospital on collecting and analyzing some data and prototyping applications/devices/detection techniques, and in general help improve the understanding of the field, or you work on applying these concepts to LLMs and LVMs and checking what these models are doing kinda similar to humans, what works better in humans and maybe if we can replicate this somehow in these models.\n\nAgain, it's a crude take. \n\nAs for your motivations, they sound fair. I got into the field because of similar reasons, but you have to pick a thing and start I guess. There's always too many potential things to start doing and that's a problem of maximizing the ROI. Not really a \"best\" thing or path to choose. Maybe try choosing the one which will make you less miserable or something.\n\n  \nI'd recommend diving into both topics superficially, reading some survey papers (or just hop on acl anthology or IEEE or something), analyse what you can do, what you need to learn, and how much time you'd need to do that, and then estimate which one sounds like a better plan. Both options are quite valid and you'd find some ways to continue your work in academia (of course by compromising and mixing topics and being a bit creative).\n\nCheers and good luck.",
