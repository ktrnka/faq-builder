    "title": "Help me choose between two AI thesis projects: Multi-agent Simulations vs. Low-Resource Machine Translation",
    "author": "DoubleDescent365",
    "selftext": "I'm at a crossroads with my thesis project and could use some advice from the community. I've got two options on the table, and I'm trying to figure out which one might be better for my future career. Here are the projects:\n\n1. Multi-agent Simulations for AI Safety:\n\n   - Builds on an existing paper about using LLMs in simulated environments to study AI cooperation and governance\n\n   - Potentially jailbreaking LLMs for further testing of collaborations across agents with reduced guardrails\n\n   - Related to projects like Meta's CICERO and Salesforce's AI Economist\n\n2. Low-Resource Machine Translation with LLMs:\n\n   - Aims to improve translation quality for low-resource languages using Large Language Models\n\n   - Involves analyzing LLM errors and developing new decoding techniques\n\n   - Builds on a long-standing challenge in NLP\n\nI'm trying to decide which project would be better in terms of achieving exposure and visibility to both private companies and research institutions, as well as future potential and career opportunities down the line.\n\nWhat do you think? Which project would you choose if you were in my shoes? Any insights on which field might have more growth or interesting developments in the coming years?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",
