Iâ€™m realizing there's a lot I donâ€™t know about **serving** models in production.\n\nWhere can I start learning about these concepts? How do I go from a \"toy framework\" to something thatâ€™s actually **deployed** and running? Like is there anyplace/course for me to practice with third  parties like AWS Any resources or advice would be greatly appreciated!",

Years ago I remember seeing platforms that let you simply upload a sklean, pytorch, or tf model and it'd serve for you. If you can find a modern platform like that, it might be a good way to get started, then you can add CI/CD (I'd suggest Github Actions for that). Before getting into a low-level AWS design, you might try Sagemaker. Then after Sagemaker it'd good to understand the low level of how all the pieces work.\n\nI'd expect that there are good MLOps courses online these days but I haven't reviewed any so I can't make any recommendations. Hopefully another commenter will be able to chime in.\n\nHope this helps, and feel free to ask questions!",
