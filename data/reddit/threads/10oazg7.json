Lets say I want it to predict Basketball player performance. So I have all the player stats in the data set, but I want to incorporate the strength of the player matchup, so I would need a separate table for the opposing teams metrics vs certain positions. How do I do that? Is this only accomplished via feature engineering?\n\nany help is appreciated, thank you  \n\n\ntl;dr if i have a data table that is a subset of the main data how do I incorporate that?",

The event is assumed to have heterogeneous effects due to the nature of the customer base (impacted customers in some regions more than others) and was not part of an experimental study.\n\nI've tried:\nUsing Arima time series modeling based upon the metric, fitting on the time period prior to the event, predicting after the event, and comparing the predicted values to the actual ones. However, Arima doesn't appear to be appropriate. After talking to my product team, there appears to be monthly seasonality, as well as seasonality related to the day of the week.\nSince the customer satisfaction metric is an aggregation from scores provided by individuals, I've also tried using individual scores pre-event as training and using individual scores given post-event as test, fitting traditional classification models to the training set and making predictions on the test set. To estimate the difference between the expected versus actual customer metric, I've taken the training scores and predicted test scores and calculated the aggregated metric for those records as the expected aggregate value and separately calculated the aggregated metric over the training scores and actual test values for the actual aggregate value. However, this method gives me a larger than actual estimated impact - regardless of whether or not I balance the classes during training, this modeling approach tends to predict one customer rating more frequently than the others.\n\nI've also done some reading into causality libraries/modeling approaches, like econml DML, but I'm not sure how helpful CATE would be here, since my metric of interest is an aggregation. Any suggestions?",

      "body": "Ball park conceptual number - how long does training take for AI tasks using medical volumetric data? (for example, something along the lines of training for automated segmentation of an organ using 100 CT studies). Are we talking hours? Days? Weeks? \n\nI'm new to ML and I will need a better GPU (and a PSU and maybe a bigger case), and the amount I would be willing to invest depends on how much of a difference it would make in practice.  I figure I can get a used RTX 3090 installed for about $1000 or a new RTX 4090 for about $2000, and if training correlates with AI benchmarks, then it looks like a task that takes 1 day for an A100 GPU would take 1.1 days with an RTX 4090 and 1.7 days with an RTX 3090. If the extra $1k reduces the time by weeks or days, then it should eventually be worth the cost. If it reduces the time by hours or minutes, then it's probably not worth the cost.\n\nThanks!",

I am using it to propagate satellite orbits with past TLE (two-line element) data.  \nI have a satellite with 7750 days worth of data which is split into df\\_train (pd DataFrame contains data for a chosen number of days) and df\\_test (contains the rest of the data).

I'm not sure if that API has the \"card\" info that Google shows for movies though. If not, you could search in IMDB and take the first page or two.\n\nExtracting the content from IMDB might be a pain. I'm a bit outdated there but generally I'd use a library like beautifulsoup with an xpath selector to extract the part of the webpage I wanted. You can figure out the xpath selector you need in Chrome by right clicking the part of the page you want and inspecting the element -- there's a helper in the dev tools\n\nSorry I haven't done web scraping in a couple years so I don't know what's best these days",
