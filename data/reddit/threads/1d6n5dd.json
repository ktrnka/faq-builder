      "body": "I agree ML is evolving towards cloud-based products, just like all software has done the past ~10 years. I do see a trend towards big foundation models and managed solutions.\n\nBut I ask you this: who are companies going to hire to configure, deploy, and maintain this infrastructure?\n\nIt’s not like the fields of SRE / DevOps are dead because of AWS’ monopoly on “managed solutions”. In fact the field exploded after AWS picked up steam.\n\nI would actually argue that this trend is good for MLOps engineers for a few reasons:\n\n- These tools increase iteration speed (if used properly), meaning more deployed ML features to support and just general market growth.\n- They lower the threshold for getting a functional model in production which meets performance requirements (looking back even 10 years ago, this was incredibly difficult). This means companies which aren’t using ML might consider it.\n- If you’ve interacted with a cloud provider, you understand that “managed solutions” require a lot of hands on tweaking, and get expensive really quickly. So expensive that it’s often cheaper to hire someone to reduce costs. There’s a lot of work to be done here, especially because these managed solutions are largely new and untested.\n\nBut I will say this (just my opinion): I do think a trend towards ML as a service means employers need more engineers maintaining the infrastructure and less data scientists / researchers. \n\nIt’s much safer (and cheaper) for a company to use an off-the-shelf, well proven model architecture than have a PhD design one.",
