Maybe you could automate the trainings and stop the release until all the required metrics have been checked by a human.\n\nAlso try to figure out where this level of scrutiny is coming from, maybe is lack of confidence on the technology or a misunderstanding of what your team is capable of; knowing the source will help you address it.
