I have a trained model that I want to test, monitor and update automaticaly whenever I push new code or data to my repository.\n\nI’m looking for some advice on how to build a CI/CD pipeline for this scenario. What tools do you use and recomend? How do you handle testing, validation, deployment and monitoring of your ML models? What are some best practices and common pitfalls to avoid?\n\nI have some experience with Jenkins and GitHub Actions, but I’m not sure if they are suitable for ML projects. Are there any specific plugins or integrations that I should use? Are there any alternatives that are more tailored for ML workflows?\n\nI would apreciate any feedback or suggestions from the community. Thanks in advance!",
