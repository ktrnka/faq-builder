While Iâ€™m improving my programming skills due to the significant amount of coding involved, I feel that my ML expertise isnâ€™t advancing as much as I anticipated.\n\nMy current responsibilities are often not deeply ML-focused.

At the same time I don't work with large and distrubted systems where I can at least develop another set of skills.\n2. **Early-Stage Startup Constraints**: As is common in early-stage startups, there is minimal mentorship or guidance from senior engineers. This environment, while providing broad exposure, makes it challenging to specialize or gain depth in ML.\n3. **\"Jack of All Trades master of none\" ...**: My role feels like itâ€™s expanding into many adjacent areas (e.g., DevOps, automation), making me worry that Iâ€™m becoming a generalist without mastery in ML.\n4. **Future Career Concerns**: I have a friend with a similar background who faced significant difficulties securing a role matching his years of experience when he tried to switch companies.
