Some examples of differentiators:\n\n* Modeling intervention adherence, whether that's drugs or behaviors\n* Finding a good way to represent behavioral changes, including smoking, alcohol, exercise, sleep, eating, or whatever's relevant for the medical conditions you support\n* Modeling medical history of the patient: This can be very challenging\n* How to best model the treatment effect across a range of treatments: In some situations, you may want to estimate the effect on survival. With other conditions, you may estimate the effect on some other measurables (such as blood pressure)\n\nAdverse effects could be very promising. The challenge is that the structured data sometimes doesn't have the full, up-to-date medication list. If we prescribe something, we might be able to identify adverse effects in the subsequent chief complaint(s) even if we don't have a complete medication history.\n\nAgain, many people oversimplify medical AI/ML and it'd stand out to really try and deal with the challenges of realistic medical data.\n\n  \nHappy to toss out other examples if this helps!",
