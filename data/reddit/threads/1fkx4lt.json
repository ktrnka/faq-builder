      "body": "Not sure if any of these would work but maybe they'll inspire better ideas:\n\nCausal inference or related methods to estimate the effects of local government policies, such as \n\n- Building a dataset of local policies around masking/etc for covid and seeing if they had an effect on reported covid rates / mortality, while controlling for confounders like age, sex, avg pre-existing health, population density, etc.\n\n- There were a wide range of policing changes in the wake of George Floyd and others. For instance, non-police for mental health crises or community watches. Were those effective? I suspect that there are many confounders to control for, and the data might be tough to collect, but that'd make such an interesting read.\n\n- Recently there have been a few different attempts to study universal basic income but I don't know if anyone's done a meta-review of them yet.\n\nThere might be some interesting analyses connecting air quality to health issues. I believe that's been studied but there's probably more to explore and there's a good amount of data on both, I just don't know if the health data has specific-enough locations. Lots of confounders to control for.\n\nWork from home or return to office policies are a hot topic right now. There have been some studies out there about productivity impact (I think from Microsoft and/or McKinsey). I'd be curious if there were time-series effects, like if the findings might've been different during the early COVID period (US outbreak until US vaccine, for instance) vs today.\n\nI wish I had better ideas for you, but best of luck!",
