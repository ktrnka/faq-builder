      "body": "I want to thank community for this possibility to ask simple time series question. Please don't reply \"jump in window\" (it is bad advice from statistical PoV since I'm on the second floor)\n\nI'm new to time series topic in particular and in ML in general. I have tried *ARDL* model with no seasonal part and no exog variables (from statsmodels.tsa.api import ARDL). I'm working with very small dataset of 16 points (see Appendix 1) with strict trend component.\n\nThis TS is stationary according to *adfuller* test inspite of it is not stationary due to simple criteria like \"moving average have to be kind of constant\". Not sure if this test even applicable for such a small number of points.\n\nImagine i want to forecast next nine(sic!) points and i have no idea how to choose best number of lags. Hence I fit my model for several different nlags on TS\\[:-9\\] dataset (train set) and choose the best lag by comparing MAE/MSE/R2 on TS\\[-9:\\] dataset (test set). Best lag is lags = 1.\n\nIn spite of all ugliness of the idea to forecast 9 points having 16-9=7 points the prediction plot is well fitted with test data plot. This result convinced me to to go further (from common mathematical sense).\n\nNow I have to decide :\n\n(1) to use the model above (trained on  TS\\[:-9\\] set) to predict TS\\[16:26\\] values for which i have very good R2 on nine predictions.\n\n(2) or i have to refit the lags = 1 model with all my points ( TS\\[:\\] ) but without the chance to test it for nine predictions\n\nAnd i have no idea how to choose the best option, so i decided to research convergence of model's coefficients (*m.params*). My plan is to fit nine models for nine sets TS\\[:-9\\], TS\\[:-8\\], TS\\[:-7\\],...TS\\[:-0\\] and to check whether **a** and **b** in nine consecutive models *y(t) =* ***a***\\*y(t-1) + ***b*** are tending to converge to two **a\\_lim, b\\_lim** constants. They are not. Not even close to convergence. They look random...

Please don&#39;t reply &quot;jump in window&quot; (it is bad advice from statistical PoV since I&#39;m on the second floor)</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m new to time series topic in particular and in ML in general. I have tried <em>ARDL</em> model with no seasonal part and no exog variables (from statsmodels.tsa.api import ARDL). I&#39;m working with very small dataset of 16 points (see Appendix 1) with strict trend component.</p>\n\n<p>This TS is stationary according to <em>adfuller</em> test inspite of it is not stationary due to simple criteria like &quot;moving average have to be kind of constant&quot;. Not sure if this test even applicable for such a small number of points.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine i want to forecast next nine(sic!) points and i have no idea how to choose best number of lags. Hence I fit my model for several different nlags on TS[:-9] dataset (train set) and choose the best lag by comparing MAE/MSE/R2 on TS[-9:] dataset (test set). Best lag is lags = 1.</p>\n\n<p>In spite of all ugliness of the idea to forecast 9 points having 16-9=7 points the prediction plot is well fitted with test data plot. This result convinced me to to go further (from common mathematical sense).</p>\n\n<p>Now I have to decide :</p>\n\n<p>(1) to use the model above (trained on  TS[:-9] set) to predict TS[16:26] values for which i have very good R2 on nine predictions.</p>\n\n<p>(2) or i have to refit the lags = 1 model with all my points ( TS[:] ) but without the chance to test it for nine predictions</p>\n\n<p>And i have no idea how to choose the best option, so i decided to research convergence of model&#39;s coefficients (<em>m.params</em>). My plan is to fit nine models for nine sets TS[:-9], TS[:-8], TS[:-7],...TS[:-0] and to check whether <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> in nine consecutive models <em>y(t) =</em> <strong><em>a</em></strong>*y(t-1) + <strong><em>b</em></strong> are tending to converge to two <strong>a_lim, b_lim</strong> constants.

For optimization you may want to look at the convex optimization book by Boyd, as well as the books (convex optimization, nonlinear programming) by Bertsekas. For probability, the choice probably depends on the level you're looking for - if you have sufficient background, maybe Durrett is a good starting point. For gradient boosting and neural networks I think recent papers are relatively accessible (i.e. you can look at the XGBoost paper, or any recent deep learning paper and trace the references). Hope that helps.",
