I have a master's in applied math with at least foundational knowledge in ML (so a little more theory and research than what a general bootcamp would give), but I've been having trouble with getting even interviews for ML research and applied science positions. The one thing I feel I absolutely need but don't have is specifically SWE skills, along with stuff like CI/CD, version control, web development, model pipelines and deployment. All stuff I'm working on slowly while doing part time gigs but I'd love to have a direction. This is also why I was curious about what else is important to know. So ofc SWE skills are way up there on the list of things to focus on. But then what else? \n\nAlso, as a clarification, when I said research, I meant more academically inclined research, so say someone working in computational bio or drug or materials discovery or something, what are things that they'd want to know? Industry research though is still industry focused, and ig that's where a lot of the SWE skills are more necessary.",
