    "title": "Feedback on testing accuracy of a model vs a pre-labelled corpus - Academic research",
    "author": "saebear",
    "selftext": "I am a PhD student and I have a hypothesis that an advanced language model such as RoBERTa will demonstrate lower accuracy in identifying instances of harassment within a dataset compared to human-annotated data. This is not related to identifying cyberbullying and the corpus is not from social media. I have 5000 labelled interactions, 1500 are labelled as harassment. My approach is as follows:  \n\n* Create a balanced dataset, 1500 labelled harassment and 1500 labelled as not harassment. \n* Test 3 LLM's selected based on breadth (e.g bidirectional context), depth of existing training and popularity (usage) in current related research. \n* For each LLM, I propose to run three tests. This setup allows for a fair comparison between human and LLM performance based on difference levels of context and training.\n* The three separate tests are: \n\n1. Zero-shot prompting: \n   * Provide the LLM with the dataset to annotate with a simple prompt to label each interaction as contains or does not contain\n   * This tests the baseline knowledge and how well the LLM performs with no instructions\n2. Context/Instruction prompting: \n   * Provide the LLM with the same one-page instruction document given to human annotators \n   * Use this as a prompt for the LLM to annotate the test set \n   * This tests how well the LLM performs with the same examples provided to the humans \n3. Training: \n   1. Use a 80% training set to train the LLM \n   2. Then use the trained model to annotate the remaining 20% test set \n   3. This tests whether fine-tuning on domain-specific data improves LLM performance \n\nWould greatly appreciate feedback. ",

Essentially the majority of LLM's are trained on various social media corpus for detecting cyberbullying and not for more subtle, everyday harassment between people who know each other. Not all harassment is overt with swear words and aggression and I have been testing quite a few over the past few years, including Googles original perspective api and they are very average.   \n  \n- I hadn't considered that the way the examples are presented, i will take that into consideration. \n\n- I was looking at testing it on RoBERTa, GPT4 and MACAS to see how each compared\n\n- If the dev set would be prior to step 3, what quantity would be needed for the dev dataset if I have a 3000 balanced dataset if I need a a certain amount left for Step 3 to split into a training and test set? \n\n- I will have a look at the other options, thank you for the suggestions.",

It's really tough for any sort of NLP model to detect more subtle harassment.\n\nThe part that could be tricky is what \"accuracy\" means here. If the dataset is built by observing communications and annotating them for harassment, the inter-annotator agreement may end up being a limiting factor for 1) how well humans can do on the test set 2) how well the models can learn on the training set 3) how well the models can do on the test set. It's easy to imagine low agreement on subtle harassment unless the annotation manual is really good.\n\nIf you're in that sort of situation (relatively low inter-annotator agreement), I'm not sure what would happen with the models in comparison to humans.... they might do about as well as humans if the only inter-annotator agreement is on the obvious harassment.\n\nAlternatively if the dataset is constructed a different way that might not be the same sort of issue. For example, if you built it via role-play by asking people to deliberately create subtle forms of harassment.",
