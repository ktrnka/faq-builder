I have been trying to learn machine learning (I'm a 4th-year college student EE + Math) and it's been decent as my math background helps me understand the core mathematical foundation howeverrrr when it comes to coding or making a project I'm a little too dependant on ChatGPT. I have done projects in data science and currently doing one that uses machine learning but 1) I dived into it with my professor which means I had to code for research purposes => I used ChatGPT since the beginning so even though I have projects to show I didn't code them 2) When I tried to start a project myself to learn as I code and know how to do things myself, I keep getting overwhelmed by the options or by the type of projects I wish to do followed by confusion on where and how to start and so on. If I do start I don't know which direction to go in + no accountability so I stop after a while.\n\n  \nI know plenty of resources (which is kind of a problem really) and I know the basics tbh. I just don't know what direction to go in and at what pace. Things get 0 to 100 soooo quickly. I'll be learning basic models and then I'll try to jump ahead cause I know that and boom I'm all lost (oh oh and I STILL HAVEN'T CODED ANYTHING BY MYSELF)\n\n**TLDR: People who learned and did projects for themselves before ChatGPT, how did you do it? What motivated you? What is a sign that maybe this field isn't for you?** \n\nI'm sorry if i shouldn't post this here or if I made any mistakes (I'll change whatever is needed just lmk)",
