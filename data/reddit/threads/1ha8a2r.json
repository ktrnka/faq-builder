I am getting insanely accurate results with prediction accuracy of 1 with perfect ROC curves. What could I be doing wrong? My dataset is about 100,000 or so. Should I switch to another training model or is there any way to check if my predictions are true.\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thank you in advance.",
