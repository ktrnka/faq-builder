But when learning, you can get pretty far without complex tooling. Focusing too much on tooling can be challenging because you have to learn both the concept and the tool. When I was learning ML and AI, I started from scratch with not the best code, but it helped me understand the ideas."

Almost all tools have flaws or are built for specific purposes but claim to solve bigger problems. If you don't know what a tool was built for, it's tough to use effectively. They promote positives but often don't reveal problems. Still, it's phenomenal what can be done."

Large language models can generate data but it needs grounding in reality. Annotation involves correctness and usability since systems are used by people and need to generate revenue. I've worked on setting up annotation tasks, ensuring data quality, spot checking, and adjusting annotations to fix system issues. With LLMs, you need less data overall but more specialized data for complex tasks like math proofs or physics research."

Some methods, like scanning purchased books, are clever but legally unclear. Facebook's approach using torrents is clearly illegal.

The New York Times case alleges OpenAI regurgitates entire articles, bypassing paywalls and harming revenue. Whether that's true is unclear, but it's a small minority of use. The bigger issue is negotiating revenue flow between content providers and AI firms and tracking individual uses, which current technology can't do well. This creates a gap that needs addressing."

Back then, fair use was generally accepted for training because models didn't regurgitate full content. Now models memorize and paraphrase content, raising new legal questions. We need clearer laws defining fair use and derivative works in AI. The use case matters too; for example, New York Times claims OpenAI outputs entire articles, which harms revenue.
