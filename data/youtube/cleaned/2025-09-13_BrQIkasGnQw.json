We talked about Anthropic settling a lawsuit with some book publishers for around 1.5 billion dollars. I initially thought it was about fair use and web scraping, but I was mistaken."

          "speaker": "Host",
          "text": "There were two parts to the case. One part, resolved earlier in the summer, was about fair use of web scraping. The judge didn't want to rule on that topic, so it wasn't declared illegal. The settlement we're discussing was about Anthropic using datasets that included books, like Books3 or LibGen, which were built by citizen researchers or open source developers, mostly outside industry."

          "speaker": "Host",
          "text": "Some of these datasets were obtained illegally by mass downloading books. Anthropic had used some of those datasets in the past. Meta is in trouble for a similar reason. It wasn't that Anthropic deliberately downloaded books illegally, but they pulled in open datasets without vetting them carefully."

        {
          "speaker": "Host",
          "text": "The settlement was really about illegal downloading of books. The per-book price in the settlement was higher than the actual price of the books. So, to clarify, this settlement does not settle the question of fair use. If you download a big dataset, especially in commercial space, you should check its contents and origin carefully."
