Then IBM's Deep Blue beat a grandmaster, and people said, 'That's not what we meant by AI.' The definition kept shifting as capabilities improved, like speech recognition becoming good enough but then no longer considered AI. So, AI is a fuzzy and constantly evolving term."

Also, Glenn mentioned that AI used to mean machine learning, fuzzy logic, and expert systems. Fuzzy logic had its phase in the 80s and 90s but fell out of favor. Expert systems were basically code with many if statements imitating expert knowledge, managed by software packages. Later, people stopped calling it expert systems and just called it if statements."
