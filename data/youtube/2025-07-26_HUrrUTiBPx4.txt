============================================================

[00:06] All right. Well, let me unpause and I
[00:10] will just get to it. Uh, so what I
[00:14] wanted to do, at least for the first
[00:15] half tonight, was to, uh, do more of
[00:19] like a starter AI type of project.
[00:23] uh because in the past I had
[00:27] you know walked through some of some
[00:29] side projects that I've done but there's
[00:32] a lot of concepts to learn kind of all
[00:33] at once and so I find that you know if
[00:37] it's integrating GitHub actions and an
[00:40] API and then the GitHub API
[00:44] uh you know that can be kind of a lot
[00:45] for people to learn kind of all at once
[00:47] and then you know combine that with
[00:48] GitHub marketplace
[00:50] um and so I wanted to start with
[00:52] something really really simple that
[00:54] people can follow along with um and that
[00:58] we could use as an example going
[00:59] forward.
[01:01] So I will just do that and then you know
[01:04] people might trickle in, people might
[01:05] have questions. Um so we'll see how that
[01:08] goes.
[01:11] Sounds good.
[01:13] All right. So let me
[01:17] I guess it'll be a little bit awkward.
[01:18] I'll I'll screen share for uh kind of
[01:20] like the recording even though and I'll
[01:22] try to like talk aloud so that you don't
[01:24] have to you know look away from the road
[01:25] or anything like that.
[01:33] All righty here. So let me
[01:38] let me screen share
[01:49] uh
[01:50] that window
[01:54] and it's always a little bit awkward. I
[01:57] switched over to um
[02:00] uh Ubuntu recently and so uh like zoom
[02:04] on Ubuntu works slightly differently
[02:06] than zoom on Windows but uh so uh for
[02:10] the the AI provider we'll use uh GitHub
[02:12] models um the reason for that is that it
[02:15] is uh there's like free usage so you
[02:18] don't have to like enter a credit card
[02:20] or anything and you just every time I
[02:23] forget where the web page is so every
[02:25] time I just Google GitHub models
[02:27] And then it is somewhere under here.
[02:30] Find an AI model. Yeah. All right. All
[02:34] right. And then in terms of, you know,
[02:36] they have a big catalog here of models,
[02:38] but we're doing kind of simple stuff.
[02:41] Um, the OpenAI GPT series is pretty
[02:44] good. Um, you know, 4.1 is it's a good
[02:48] place to start. Oh, uh, here we go. 4.1
[02:54] is a good place to start.
[03:01] Welcome, Adam. Yeah. So, uh, I'm just,
[03:04] you know, going through for this first
[03:05] half of it, just kind of going through
[03:06] like a really basic, you know, starter,
[03:09] um, LLM project. So, I'm just getting
[03:12] into that.
[03:18] So, what I thought we would do is
[03:21] something that's like fairly fairly
[03:23] basic here. Um, so I thought, so this is
[03:26] my, you know, Feedley. You can kind of
[03:27] see I have all these different, you
[03:29] know, news feeds. Um, one thing that I
[03:32] don't love is that the the news titles
[03:34] can be kind of like inflammatory.
[03:37] Like
[03:39] inventor claims bleach injections will
[03:41] destroy cancer tumors. Like
[03:49] I guess that's fairly neutral. I don't
[03:51] know. I don't know. I it feels a little
[03:53] bit alarmist to me. Um I kind of want to
[03:57] read the article, but uh let's see.
[04:00] Dollar Patch to debut community patio.
[04:02] Okay, fairly neutral. Um I don't really
[04:06] know what a community patio is, but all
[04:08] right. Uh
[04:13] an elusive intermediate black hole
[04:17] eating a star in this distant galaxy.
[04:18] That's kind of interesting. Um anyway,
[04:20] so there's there's a wide range of
[04:21] titles and what I thought we would do as
[04:23] a really simple kind of project is to
[04:25] use large language model to rewrite uh
[04:28] news titles. Um so that ideally so that
[04:32] when I see the news titles, they're just
[04:33] kind of like a a fairly neutral, you
[04:36] know, not uh inflaming emotions, not
[04:39] really injecting a lot of bias, just
[04:41] sort of saying like giving me the
[04:43] information to tell if I actually want
[04:44] to read something instead of being like
[04:46] kind of marketing optimization. So, sort
[04:48] of like leveling the playing field in
[04:51] terms of um you know what the titles
[04:53] are. So, uh we're going to go rewrite a
[04:57] title. Um and so with a prompt, you have
[05:02] the directions and then you have the
[05:04] input to it. So, we're going to have the
[05:06] directions, which is going to be like,
[05:07] okay, debias this title, and then the
[05:10] input to it. So, we could say maybe
[05:12] let's pick this this Ballard one here.
[05:15] Um maybe we would put put in like the
[05:18] existing title and then we can like copy
[05:21] paste the first little bit here.
[05:24] So
[05:28] let's go over here. So this is GPT4.1.
[05:31] Uh for a lot of situations we probably
[05:34] would not want to uh use this like it's
[05:38] a more expensive model so we can't run
[05:40] it all the time. We would probably want
[05:41] to use like 41 mini or 41 nano. But for
[05:45] starting out, we can try this out and
[05:46] then we can can switch once it works a
[05:48] little bit. Uh, all right. Here. So,
[05:54] so in this case, we can split the prompt
[05:58] up into in the actual use case, we'll
[06:00] probably split the prompt into two. One
[06:01] is the overall directions and one is the
[06:03] example that we're putting in. So, here,
[06:06] let's say,
[06:07] uh, you're
[06:11] uh, let's see.
[06:14] Let's see here. You're going to help me
[06:18] debias news titles. I don't like that
[06:23] some titles are highly inflammatory
[06:30] or exaggerated.
[06:34] I prefer titles
[06:37] that clearly indicate what the art
[06:41] article is about
[06:44] in terms that I
[06:48] know and understand.
[06:51] Um, let's see.
[06:57] We're really seeking to level the
[07:02] playing field
[07:06] in terms of
[07:08] titles.
[07:11] I'll
[07:14] provide you
[07:16] with a title and
[07:20] snippet from an article and
[07:26] you'll rewrite the title the title
[07:31] into a more neutral
[07:36] contentrich
[07:39] uh the style so that I can gauge whether
[07:45] I want to read the article or not.
[07:51] Uh let's see here. So some of the other
[07:53] settings in here, the response format
[07:55] can be text or JSON. Uh we don't for
[07:58] this I'm starting off with something
[08:00] simple. Um so it'll just be text. Uh we
[08:03] might get to JSON later if we have time.
[08:06] Uh max completion tokens. This is just
[08:08] how much it can output. Uh, a token
[08:11] isn't exactly a word, but you can think
[08:13] of it like a a word. It's like a a word
[08:16] fragment. So, a long word might have
[08:18] multiple. A short word might be just
[08:20] one.
[08:21] Temperature. Um, so like it says
[08:24] controls randomness. You want it to be
[08:26] lower to be more deterministic. Uh,
[08:29] typically researchers have standardized
[08:32] on around 0.2 2 or 0.3
[08:36] uh for these kinds of tasks where you
[08:37] want it to behave consistently.
[08:41] Um, and I'm not going to change these
[08:43] other ones.
[08:45] Okay. So, let's take this one here.
[08:49] Uh, whoops. Oh. So, Ballard's like the
[08:53] neighborhood over from me. Um, or maybe
[08:55] it's two neighborhoods over.
[08:58] So, there's the title.
[09:01] And then let's just copy this part. Is
[09:04] there more?
[09:06] Uh there's a bit more. This page is
[09:08] rendering real weird. Probably probably
[09:10] because I have ad block on.
[09:17] And then
[09:19] actually since I do like to do these
[09:22] scientifically,
[09:23] uh do either of you want to should we
[09:26] take a guess of whether it's going to
[09:28] work well on the first try?
[09:39] If I had to guess, if I had to guess,
[09:41] it'll probably output only a very
[09:44] slightly revised title in this one
[09:47] because it is pretty contentheavy.
[09:50] Yeah, it's always a tossup, huh?
[09:54] The reason why I I like to try to um
[09:58] think about it ahead of time is because
[10:02] uh
[10:04] it helps refine like what we're doing
[10:06] here. So I think if it changes it
[10:07] drastically that would be a surprise to
[10:09] us and tell us that you know maybe our
[10:11] understanding is wrong. Um but but yeah
[10:14] let's let's say our bet here is that it
[10:17] probably won't change too much because
[10:19] this title is already fine. Um,
[10:22] let's see.
[10:37] Let's see. Ballard peep patch to open
[10:39] new community patio. Same same thing but
[10:42] capitalized. Designed and built by local
[10:44] high school students at annual art
[10:48] in the garden festival. Actually, that's
[10:51] kind of cool. I
[10:52] Yeah, that's a bit more context.
[10:55] It's a bit more context. And I think
[10:59] it kind of tells me like why there's an
[11:01] article at all, you know, like it's just
[11:03] like like local high school student
[11:05] project. That's that's pretty cool. I
[11:07] dig that.
[11:10] All right. Now, so we would say
[11:15] that's pretty I'll thumbs up that thing.
[11:18] I don't actually know. So, thumbs up in
[11:20] general is propagating feedback um back
[11:24] to the API provider. I don't actually
[11:27] know if it's saved anywhere in um you
[11:31] know over in here. So, I usually don't
[11:35] use the user interface for these kinds
[11:37] of things, but all right. So, that one
[11:38] that one worked out. Let's pick a
[11:41] different one. Um,
[11:47] all right.
[11:53] And this distant galaxy. So, this one
[11:55] actually could be interesting because I
[11:57] I'm curious to see if it um I wonder if
[12:02] we should we should probably start over
[12:03] again. Yeah, we should probably start
[12:05] over.
[12:07] Let me just double Let me make sure I
[12:09] have that saved there.
[12:11] All right.
[12:15] Whoops.
[12:18] Um, so it might actually simplify the
[12:20] terminology in this one. I I'm curious
[12:22] to see if that happens. Um I vaguely
[12:26] remember what an intermediate mass black
[12:28] hole is but um I like you have sort of
[12:34] regular mass black holes and then you
[12:37] have sort of that are formed in you know
[12:40] when a a star collapses
[12:43] um in a certain way and then you have
[12:45] super massive black holes that are you
[12:47] know enormous like the center of the
[12:49] Milky Way that you know pulls it all
[12:51] together and then there's there's this
[12:53] like middle ground where if I remember
[12:56] right, we're not sure how they form.
[12:58] Um,
[13:00] but
[13:03] anyway,
[13:04] we'll see. I'll just copy paste a bunch
[13:06] of stuff here. I So, my bet here is that
[13:10] based off of how the Ballard one went,
[13:12] it might add like a little bit more and
[13:15] it might simplify this this terminology
[13:20] here around intermediate mass. Um,
[13:29] astronomers detect X-ray emission
[13:32] suggesting possible intermediate black
[13:34] mass black hole consuming a star in
[13:36] distant galaxy NGC
[13:39] 6099.
[13:40] Uh, h
[13:46] that
[13:49] it's better in some ways.
[13:54] Because I I like that it uh it says, you
[13:58] know,
[13:59] like why are we even talking about this?
[14:01] We're talking about this because of, you
[14:02] know, detection of e x-rays.
[14:05] And that's pretty cool.
[14:08] Um,
[14:11] you know, I I don't know uh which Galaxy
[14:15] NGC 6099 is, so that part is not very
[14:18] helpful to me. But okay, the rest is all
[14:22] right.
[14:24] And one thing though, uh oh, someone
[14:27] else wanted to show. Okay. One thing
[14:29] here though that I don't like is that we
[14:32] have, you know, it it didn't just
[14:35] generate the the title rewrite, but it
[14:38] also generated this sort of like header
[14:40] here. Hey mod. Uh we're just kind of
[14:44] going through a real basic uh you know
[14:47] large language model to rewrite news
[14:50] titles.
[14:53] Cool. Thanks.
[14:54] Yep.
[14:57] Um so this one that one's okay. I don't
[15:00] know. My guess it's right next to
[15:03] NGC6098.
[15:07] Oh. Uh,
[15:12] actually, I have no idea. I have
[15:15] I don't I don't know how they number
[15:17] them either. It's like a zip code.
[15:21] It's definitely not a zip code. I think
[15:22] I'm pretty sure it's um the order in
[15:24] which they're detected.
[15:27] Um I think the the C's are usually like
[15:30] catalog. So this might be like
[15:32] oh
[15:33] something catalog
[15:35] uh object 6099 something like that.
[15:40] New galactic catalog
[15:42] maybe. Yeah for the new galaxy or the I
[15:45] guess it's the new catalog maybe. I
[15:46] don't know. But uh all right. So that
[15:49] that one's okay. I I do kind of like
[15:52] that it's more neutral than like the
[15:54] question form.
[15:56] Um, although the question form is kind
[15:58] of what the the article's about.
[16:02] Um,
[16:05] let's see.
[16:08] Ice in space isn't the same as ice on
[16:10] Earth. I mean, I'm going to be tempted
[16:12] into clicking half of these things. I
[16:14] I'm just whatever. I'm just going to
[16:15] pick the top few.
[16:18] All right,
[16:21] let's try this bleach injection one.
[16:26] Uh,
[16:28] and part of the reason why we're doing
[16:30] this, um, guess I'll go and get a quote
[16:34] if I can. Um, part of the reason why
[16:37] we're doing multiple examples is
[16:39] because,
[16:40] um, it's if you test it only with one
[16:43] example, you might find that it works
[16:45] great or it works horribly, but like
[16:47] each example it's going to do a little
[16:49] bit differently at. So, you want to run
[16:51] through at least a few examples. If this
[16:54] were a big system, you would want to run
[16:56] through maybe like a hundred examples
[16:58] and sort of label like what good output
[17:00] looks like. But, you know, we're just
[17:02] start sort of starting small here.
[17:07] All right. So, again, it's doing this
[17:10] thing here. I really don't like is that
[17:12] um the output format varies quite a bit.
[17:16] Uh so, so if we're going to well, we'll
[17:19] get to why that's a problem once we're
[17:20] calling this from Python, but let's see.
[17:22] The original title inventor claims
[17:24] bleach injection will distort cancer
[17:26] tumors. Debiased whatever unlicensed
[17:30] inventor promotes unproven chlorine
[17:33] dioxide injections
[17:35] for cancer treatment. Uhhuh.
[17:39] I guess that's more neutral.
[17:46] Uh
[17:50] oh.
[17:53] This is one where I would say like,
[17:54] okay, the the revised title
[18:01] is better in my opinion. I guess I'll
[18:04] thumbs up that. Um, but it's something
[18:08] that like once the title is sort of
[18:09] rewritten, it's more clear that this
[18:12] isn't really news, you know, like like
[18:15] some random dude proposed
[18:19] some medical treatment. Like there's a
[18:22] lot of random people out there. Like I
[18:24] don't I don't need I don't need to hear
[18:26] about every, you know, whoever is
[18:28] proposing medical treatment uh if
[18:31] they're on license. I don't I don't care
[18:32] about that. Uh that shouldn't I don't
[18:35] think that should be news. Anyway, so
[18:37] part of part of why I'm talking through
[18:39] this is because at some point we're
[18:41] going to want to structure the data and
[18:43] I'm starting to think through okay what
[18:45] um how do we want to structure the data?
[18:47] So one part of it might be okay you know
[18:50] what's the the just the revised title.
[18:54] Um another part might be um you know why
[18:57] are we revising the title that kind of
[18:59] thing. And so, you know, when we go to
[19:02] response format JSON, we're going to
[19:03] say, okay, provide a JSON response and
[19:07] um and then we will we'll sort of work
[19:10] through that.
[19:12] Uh, okay. So, we did that. Now, let me
[19:18] um
[19:24] let me make a Oh, that's right. I'm
[19:28] sharing. I'm probably sharing my Chrome
[19:29] window. Um, let me see if I can share
[19:33] that second monitor.
[19:36] Yeah, it's like whatever the COVID one
[19:39] was. I I don't remember what that one
[19:41] was.
[19:43] System desktop capture, I think, is what
[19:45] I want.
[19:51] Okay.
[19:54] All righty.
[19:57] So, let's say make um what we call this
[20:01] news title rewriter.
[20:05] Actually, we're probably going to want
[20:06] it to be a git repo anyway. So, um
[20:11] let's create a new repository.
[20:15] News title rewriter.
[20:19] And sure, it can be
[20:24] public. Uh, do I want to read me? Sure,
[20:29] why not? And then
[20:32] probably want a get ignore for Python.
[20:35] Create a repo.
[20:38] And then we'll say
[20:42] local
[20:45] sync. Let's see here.
[20:49] get a clone
[20:51] do that.
[20:54] Enter passphrase for SSH key. Hopefully
[20:58] I have this all set up correctly.
[21:01] All right.
[21:03] And then I like to use VS Code.
[21:11] All right.
[21:15] And I do not want that extension.
[21:20] And then I like to use UV as my um
[21:25] it's my Python thingy. So I'll say UV in
[21:28] it.
[21:31] This is my uh virtual environment. It's
[21:33] my environment manager. So it'll like
[21:35] manage um you know say okay you need
[21:38] this version of Python and this is where
[21:39] we're going to set up dependencies and
[21:40] that sort of thing.
[21:42] Um all right
[21:46] version created a main.py. All right.
[21:49] Cool.
[21:57] Okay. So created a virtual environment.
[21:59] There it is hooked into Visual Studio
[22:03] Code which usually catches me off guard.
[22:06] Um but all right. So
[22:10] say initial project setup.
[22:17] All right.
[22:19] Sync those changes up.
[22:27] Okay, that looks fine. And now we can go
[22:30] back to here and we can see the stuff
[22:33] all the stuff that we did here. And then
[22:36] now where is the the
[22:41] button in here? Use this model. So
[22:45] Python and
[22:48] you know you have a bunch of different
[22:49] option. It gives you like sample code.
[22:51] Um so we'll use Python, we'll use OpenAI
[22:55] SDK.
[22:56] Um
[23:00] I I will create the personal access
[23:02] token in a minute. I'll have to do that
[23:03] offscreen.
[23:05] Uh we'll do this stuff.
[23:09] So
[23:11] here we'll say UV add open AAI.
[23:15] So it goes and installs that and it
[23:17] updates our PI project UV lock. Great.
[23:22] And it gives us you know some sample
[23:24] code here.
[23:27] And we'll paste that over into main.
[23:34] Uh, let's see here.
[23:38] Oh, yeah. It's complaining about stuff.
[23:40] Sure. Um,
[23:44] I think I'll put this in main.
[23:48] I'm just going to It's just going to be
[23:50] a really basic like main.
[23:54] Um,
[24:01] all right.
[24:04] So, that part's set up. Now, let's do
[24:10] since I'm short on time, I'm going to do
[24:12] a few small things with um
[24:18] actually in one second, uvia.n.
[24:23] All right.
[24:25] Okay.
[24:29] N import load.n.
[24:31] This will say loadn.
[24:35] Yep. Yep. Yep.
[24:38] We'll say touch.n.
[24:42] So touch is a command that will create a
[24:44] file without modifying it. We can see
[24:46] here that is already in the git ignore.
[24:49] That's great. Um, so now, so the whole
[24:52] purpose of doing this this setup here
[24:53] with the end is a place for me to put
[24:56] this secret key. So this GitHub token,
[24:59] so if I share this gub token with some,
[25:01] you know, anyone on the internet, um,
[25:03] they can use up my quota. Uh, if that
[25:07] GitHub token has a lot of permissions,
[25:09] they could delete my repos. They could
[25:11] do all these things that would be
[25:12] horrible. And so it's one of these
[25:14] things that you want to keep very
[25:15] private, like a password. And so the
[25:18] setup of putting it in a
[25:20] um the reason why that helps is because
[25:23] it's listed in the the ignore. So it's
[25:28] very very unlikely that we'll
[25:29] accidentally commit this. Like we're not
[25:31] going to accidentally add it because it
[25:33] doesn't none of the nothing will
[25:35] automatically add it for us. Um and so
[25:38] we don't have to worry about that too
[25:40] much. Um, and it also means that like
[25:43] I'm not going to be showing the GitHub
[25:46] token here over in Maine. And so, you
[25:49] know, even for this recording, it's not
[25:51] going to be just like recorded out there
[25:52] on the the web. Um, I'll try to show you
[25:55] some of the stuff when I'm when I'm
[25:56] going through and creating the um
[25:58] personal access token, though. Um, so
[26:02] let's generate a new token.
[26:05] Um, so one of the things, let's see. So,
[26:09] one of the things it said was that we
[26:11] need it to have the model read
[26:14] permission.
[26:17] Um, that's not in this tokens classic
[26:19] one, but it is in the fine grain ones.
[26:21] Um, that's that's one that like I think
[26:23] it used to be in tokens classic, but
[26:25] it's not anymore, I guess. So, we can
[26:27] generate a new token. We will say news
[26:31] title rewriter.
[26:35] Uh, it's owned by me. And then another
[26:38] way that you can do something uh fairly
[26:42] secure is you can just set it to expire
[26:44] very quickly. So that way if you know
[26:46] say if it gets into the recording and it
[26:48] gets onto the internet um you know by
[26:50] some accident uh hopefully it will have
[26:53] expired by then.
[26:57] And then models here is what we need. We
[27:00] need read only generate token.
[27:05] Uh,
[27:08] wait, did I do something wrong
[27:22] news
[27:24] title rewriter?
[27:28] Maybe I can't pick two days. I don't
[27:31] know. Let's see here. Um.
[27:42] All right. So, okay. Sure, sure, sure.
[27:45] Generate token.
[27:48] Well, it showed the token, so I'm just
[27:49] going to, you know, now you see the
[27:51] token. Uh, it's in the recording. I'll
[27:53] just delete it after this thing.
[27:56] Um,
[28:03] and you know, I guess you know, if
[28:05] you're
[28:06] ambitious, you could
[28:09] take that and uh
[28:13] run some queries on it. But, uh, GitHub
[28:16] uh, tokens are uh,
[28:19] like the model usage. There's there's
[28:21] you can do it on your own account. It's
[28:23] free to a degree until you run out of
[28:25] rate.
[28:26] Um, so we will go back now. We'll run
[28:31] main.py.
[28:33] So what actually happened here?
[28:37] Uh, here. I was trying to be all secure
[28:39] and then I didn't know it was going to
[28:41] show on the screen so I goofed. But uh,
[28:45] but here what it's doing it's loading
[28:47] the end. So it's grabbing and then that
[28:50] populates os.environ environ stuff from
[28:53] N. Uh we set GitHub token in there.
[28:57] The stuff down here, this is
[29:00] configuration of the OpenAI client
[29:04] saying, okay, you're going to you're
[29:06] going to use this server here, you know,
[29:08] github.asai/inference.
[29:10] We're going to use the OpenAI GPT41
[29:13] model, and then we're going to call this
[29:15] chat completions.create.
[29:18] uh it sends this as input to the thing
[29:21] and I'll come back to that in a sec with
[29:23] this you know temperature top p and this
[29:25] model and then the response is this
[29:28] deeply nested structure so the chat
[29:30] completion response has a list of
[29:32] choices
[29:34] you know in theory it can generate
[29:36] multiple options simultaneously but
[29:38] people mostly use it to generate one so
[29:40] there's generally one and then under
[29:42] that there's a message and that message
[29:44] has a content there's a bunch of other
[29:45] stuff in there too but Um,
[29:48] so what we could do if you're curious is
[29:51] we can do like pretty print.
[29:54] Um, let's try pretty printing the full
[29:56] response object
[30:10] or maybe just message. I think I can do
[30:13] that.
[30:19] All right.
[30:24] All right. So, capital Francis Paris.
[30:26] And you can see it's got this content
[30:28] here. There's no refusal. It's the role
[30:31] of the assistant. There's no really
[30:33] interesting stuff in there.
[30:35] So, let's try choices. See what's in
[30:37] there.
[30:57] All right.
[31:00] So here we can see our our chat
[31:02] completion response.
[31:04] Um this finish region and stop tells us
[31:07] like why how it got to the end. So um if
[31:11] we had said you can only generate five
[31:13] words, it might say well I used up all
[31:15] my five words. So it would give us a
[31:16] different like a length here instead of
[31:18] stop. Uh we are not returning log
[31:22] probabilities.
[31:25] Um
[31:27] there's no concerns about hate speech or
[31:30] anything like that. So it's got Okay. So
[31:31] it's got some other stuff in there.
[31:34] All right. So now
[31:40] uh let's go over to
[31:53] I think I closed it actually.
[31:59] Show full history here.
[32:05] Oh well, maybe I close that window.
[32:17] All right. Yeah, maybe I close that
[32:18] window then. Um, okay. So,
[32:26] so for the system we would say
[32:30] uh you're
[32:32] going to help me rewrite
[32:36] news titles to be more neutral.
[32:41] neutral so that
[32:44] neutral and in plain language
[32:48] so that I can more easily decide whether
[32:54] to whether I want to read the article
[32:59] uh we're attempting
[33:03] to let me graph
[33:06] uh reduce
[33:11] bias and in
[33:14] sensationalism in news headlines.
[33:20] Uh oops.
[33:22] Oh yeah. Uh so a lot of times I like to
[33:24] do uh triple quotes here so that I can
[33:27] do some spacing.
[33:32] I'll provide you with a news headline
[33:38] and optional snippet
[33:41] of the article and you will
[33:46] rewrite the headline
[33:50] uh
[33:51] to be more neutral and straightforward.
[33:53] Okay.
[33:56] All right.
[34:00] So,
[34:02] and just doing a little time check here.
[34:05] I am going to use
[34:20] maybe I'll do about five more minutes of
[34:21] this and then check if we got uh
[34:24] questions and stuff we wanted to talk
[34:25] about. Uh, let's see. Rewrite headline.
[34:30] Okay, great. So, we want to take a
[34:33] headline and a snippet. Snippet is
[34:35] optional. It's going to return that.
[34:37] Okay, great.
[34:39] Um, what I want to do here
[34:43] is to say, you know, all right, we're
[34:46] going to do all that stuff here.
[34:52] [Music]
[34:55] So, our client
[35:00] I guess we can put all that in there.
[35:06] So, we got our token
[35:09] response. All right. And now we want to
[35:12] say return response choices message
[35:15] content.
[35:16] Uh there. So, I do have pretty
[35:20] aggressive type checking turned on. And
[35:22] what it's warning us about here is that
[35:23] some of these can be um none
[35:27] um when I'm sort of saying I want it to
[35:28] return a string. So uh we will let that
[35:33] error out but just sort of to to be
[35:35] aware of. Um all right. So
[35:41] so headline
[35:46] and then snippet that. All right. Then
[35:50] we'll say
[35:52] rewrite equals that. Then we'll say
[35:55] print.
[35:58] Delete that.
[36:02] All righty. So now we have a headline
[36:05] and a snippet, but we're not actually
[36:06] using it.
[36:08] And so to use it, we have to paste put
[36:11] it into this user thing. Typically
[36:14] you'll see the the big picture
[36:15] directions in system and then the little
[36:17] picture direction you know kind of the
[36:19] the actual input here in user.
[36:22] So here I'll do the triple coded thing
[36:24] again because I find it's um easier to
[36:26] read um if I if I did that. All right
[36:33] snippet. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[36:37] Great.
[36:39] And then I'll just sort of strip off any
[36:42] kind of new lines, any extra new lines
[36:45] that we don't need or white space.
[36:48] Um, and then temperature, what we did
[36:50] before I think was three
[36:54] because we don't want it to be too
[36:55] creative. All right.
[36:58] Now we'll say, all right,
[37:01] print.
[37:04] No, we'll say.
[37:13] All right.
[37:17] We should probably put that over in here
[37:19] as kind of a debug message.
[37:26] And then
[37:28] uh so let's do this one again.
[37:32] Ballard Patch thing. Um,
[37:38] do that. And then we'll just copy paste
[37:40] a bunch here.
[37:46] And then one of the nice things with um
[37:48] triple quoted strings is that like I can
[37:51] kind of just paste it and it preserves
[37:53] this this like structure here which is
[37:55] makes it a little bit easier to read.
[37:57] All right. So, that will do that and
[38:01] then we're going to have to deal with
[38:02] maybe we'll have to deal with that.
[38:05] But
[38:09] all right,
[38:10] so the rewritten headline
[38:13] it again it has this, you know, neutral
[38:15] plain language headline. Um, in this
[38:18] time to open new community patio at
[38:21] annual art and garden festival.
[38:25] Uh, it basically didn't change it at
[38:27] all.
[38:28] Uh, which is kind of like what we
[38:30] thought last time. What what might have
[38:31] happened? Let's try this black hole on.
[38:56] All right.
[39:00] So, astronomers find evidence of a
[39:01] possible intermediate black hole in a
[39:03] distant galaxy. Actually, I kind of like
[39:05] that title a little bit better than the
[39:07] sort of the question questioned one. Um,
[39:11] but we have this stuff around here. So,
[39:13] we couldn't just like rewrite the title
[39:15] because we have all this this sort of
[39:17] junk around here. Um, so maybe I will
[39:22] pause there for a second. Let me clean
[39:25] this up a little bit. Format the
[39:27] document and then I'll say I'll write
[39:29] some to-do comments here.
[39:34] To-do.
[39:38] So, one is improve the prompt.
[39:43] Um, the results seemed
[39:48] a little worse
[39:51] than what we had in the UI.
[39:57] So all right here to
[40:01] uh let's see here
[40:07] use JSON plus JSON mode plus piantic
[40:13] to return a structured response so that
[40:17] we don't
[40:20] uh have to yeah to parse the string
[40:25] and can easily Y
[40:28] Ignore things like
[40:32] uh
[40:34] this here
[40:37] neutral plain language headline
[40:42] three um
[40:48] CLI interface
[40:51] let's see take a URL as input and script
[40:56] headline snippet from the page. Great
[41:00] for CLI interface. That makes sense. I
[41:04] agree with that. And then what else did
[41:07] we see in here that we haven't talked
[41:09] about yet?
[41:16] Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'll put a to-do here.
[41:23] to do um handle type errors,
[41:31] null response, etc. Better.
[41:38] All right. Sorry. So, I I was hoping to
[41:41] pick the smallest thing I could possibly
[41:43] imagine so that we could um do it in uh
[41:46] uh you know, like 45 minutes or so, but
[41:48] that didn't didn't quite work out the
[41:50] way I was expecting. Um, did anyone have
[41:53] like just questions about this or or you
[41:57] know topics or or anything that they
[41:59] wanted to bring up?
[42:08] Um, nothing really. Well, um, are you
[42:12] going to be doing anything with the, uh,
[42:14] I guess there's a challenge week next
[42:16] week?
[42:18] Uh, I didn't I haven't heard about that.
[42:21] What's What's that?
[42:24] Uh I'm not 100% sure. There was a with
[42:27] the the email went out um you know
[42:30] what's coming up in the following week.
[42:33] And uh it looks like they're going to be
[42:36] going into
[42:38] having some different teams and doing
[42:40] some AI coding to do some challenges.
[42:44] Oh, interesting. No, I hadn't I hadn't
[42:46] heard about that at all, actually. Um
[42:49] let me actually while we're talking
[42:50] about that let me stop sharing and um
[42:53] Sunday um Sunday is the kickoff party.
[42:56] So if you want to know more information
[42:58] you can join us Sunday morning.
[43:01] Ah
[43:05] and then we would meet up every day.
[43:09] Oh so it's like a every day kind of
[43:11] thing. Okay that's cool.
[43:12] Mhm.
[43:17] It's for one week, not long, but
[43:20] so kind of like a hackathon of of sorts.
[43:23] Yeah.
[43:23] Yeah.
[43:24] Yeah. Resembling a hackathon. I think
[43:27] the intent was to uh also um I think
[43:30] they're inviting people that uh aren't
[43:33] necessarily part of Joy of Coding, but
[43:35] you know, want are interested and want
[43:38] to want to join. So,
[43:43] okay. it coding challenge
[43:46] week. Wait,
[43:52] let's see what I can find.
[43:55] [Music]
[43:57] I don't see too much online, but uh
[44:04] they're still fine tuning the challenge,
[44:06] so you may not find anything. Yeah.
[44:09] Okay. Yeah, I'll have to I'll have to um
[44:11] like look over the Discord to sort of
[44:13] see. Um
[44:17] yeah, I'm not sure uh actually if yeah
[44:20] what's in Discord about it. Um I I know
[44:23] uh just from reading the email um from
[44:27] Dr. Emily. She does that like Sunday
[44:29] email about what's what's coming up in
[44:32] the in the week.
[44:34] Uh if you join Katrina's Q&A, she would
[44:37] have more information. She's the one
[44:39] helping Dr. Emily's design.
[44:48] Oh, I'm actually trying out the uh the
[44:50] code tutor bot to see if it can answer.
[44:59] Oh, I guess. Yeah. So, I guess they
[45:02] haven't gotten the um ETL working, but
[45:05] uh so it doesn't have anywhere
[45:07] information anyway. Yeah, I'll look into
[45:08] it um later. That's interesting. Um so
[45:12] it's like so hackathon like a week-long
[45:14] hackathon on like AI type projects.
[45:17] Um yeah, that can I've learned a lot
[45:20] from doing like hackathons in the AI
[45:22] space. Definitely recommend it.
[45:29] I wonder if we're using GitHub or if
[45:31] we're using some other website
[45:34] um like Hackerink or something.
[45:38] I no idea. Um
[45:44] usually
[45:46] um
[45:52] usually what I've seen for hackathons is
[45:54] that people like share their code on
[45:56] GitHub with each other. Uh but
[46:01] beyond that
[46:04] uh you know like every project is kind
[46:06] of unique and different.
[46:13] Yeah, that makes sense.
[46:16] All right, I just deleted my uh
[46:19] inadvertently shared uh access token. So
[46:23] I've
[46:26] uh
[46:27] restored security I guess.
[46:39] Yeah. That's part of the part of the
[46:40] reason why I wanted to to do like a
[46:42] basic intro thing was to um showcase
[46:45] like GitHub models is pretty good for
[46:48] hackathon type work because um you know
[46:51] you don't have to enter a credit card or
[46:53] anything like you do with OpenAI or any
[46:55] of the others.
[46:57] um you can just just start using it and
[47:00] then you know eventually you like run
[47:02] out of free usage for the day but that's
[47:05] still like I find that
[47:10] um entering a credit card is is kind of
[47:12] like a barrier to entry for a lot of
[47:13] folks um so it sort of helps people kind
[47:16] of get unstuck uh if they're uh if
[47:19] they're in that situation.
[47:22] I have a question for you Dr. Keith. So,
[47:24] um, is it worth it to invest in
[47:28] something like Corsive to learn all the
[47:30] AI tools?
[47:32] It teaches you 30 tools in 30 days.
[47:36] But it's
[47:37] um, what's it called?
[47:39] Corsive or
[47:40] Corsive?
[47:41] Yeah. C O U R S I V. Like course.
[47:48] Corive.
[47:50] Yeah.
[47:53] Huh.
[47:56] Let's see.
[48:02] Just reading through like a
[48:05] summary of it. Actually, I'll show you
[48:08] what I usually do in these situations.
[48:10] Um, I usually ask perplexity to
[48:14] summarize, you know,
[48:17] summarize a lot of different, you know,
[48:19] uh,
[48:23] a lot of different feedback. So, okay.
[48:26] Uh,
[48:27] summarize.
[48:31] I'm considering
[48:33] Corsive
[48:35] to learn more about AI.
[48:39] Tell me what people say.
[48:44] uh admit
[48:47] in reviews.
[48:50] See what we come up with there
[48:54] falling into the course of
[48:59] each lesson is 10 to 15 feels like
[49:02] Dolingo hands-on practice
[49:06] daily challenge. It built a habit
[49:08] sentiment is popular.
[49:11] Reddit and LinkedIn discussions are
[49:12] polarized. Some call it a scam, others
[49:14] say it jump started. That's interesting.
[49:19] That is very interesting. All right.
[49:23] Better Business Bureau leans positive.
[49:25] Okay. It's good they got that.
[49:28] So I mean that seems kind of like a like
[49:30] mixed results on that particular one.
[49:32] Um,
[49:34] so I do they have like a a trial way or
[49:38] a trial period or is it just like, you
[49:40] know, they take your money and you're
[49:42] stuck with it?
[49:44] Think they take their take your money
[49:45] and you're just stuck with it. But it's
[49:46] it's a it's a they have like a
[49:49] discounted rate like for the first four
[49:51] weeks.
[49:53] Oh, okay.
[49:53] Yeah. Like like 50 cents a day or
[49:55] something. Um
[49:58] maybe checking into LinkedIn learning
[50:02] resource.
[50:06] LinkedIn might have some.
[50:10] Oh, okay. I look into it.
[50:13] It's free.
[50:13] Yeah. And if if you have the library
[50:16] card, you can go through library card
[50:19] and libraries offer the free LinkedIn
[50:22] Learning.
[50:23] Oh, okay. Yeah, you're right. They do
[50:25] have courses. Okay, I'll check it out.
[50:29] Just uh also a simple uh little course
[50:32] of reviews. Um
[50:35] Gemini brings up the negative side, you
[50:38] know, although as well as I mean there's
[50:40] the positive, but the content quality.
[50:43] Several users described the content as
[50:45] superficial and lacking practical depth.
[50:50] Yeah, I was afraid if they said you're
[50:52] learning one tool a day. I'm like that's
[50:54] really fast.
[50:55] Yeah. And subscription model and hidden
[50:57] charges
[50:58] uh stuff like that. So yeah, I I think I
[51:03] did see them also before. I'm kind of
[51:06] skeptical of their uh of of that site.
[51:10] Yeah, it might be better to just like
[51:13] use some free resources.
[51:15] Yeah. beginning
[51:16] or or even if you if you went on
[51:19] something like Udemy and I I would feel
[51:23] more confident about you know plopping
[51:26] you know 10 or $20 down on a Udemy
[51:28] course before maybe something like that
[51:31] just so
[51:34] even Corsera is a
[51:37] right
[51:38] Corsera is also a subscription model but
[51:41] right yeah
[51:42] real classes like designed by
[51:44] compressors
[51:46] Yeah.
[51:47] And I think some Corsera classes are
[51:49] still free, right?
[51:51] Yeah.
[51:52] So kind of it's kind of a mixed but um I
[51:56] I will also say though that like if you
[51:58] want like a general like a high level
[52:00] sense of things
[52:02] um with learning AI
[52:05] like say if you were doing something
[52:06] like learn one tool per day for 30 days
[52:09] like you don't you don't really need 30
[52:12] tools. uh like
[52:15] um I
[52:17] and like you can't get very indepth on a
[52:22] tool in a single day. So I would say
[52:24] with with AI stuff like the
[52:29] a lot of the concepts are the same
[52:31] across tools too. So you kind of want
[52:33] want to learn like the big picture stuff
[52:34] of like okay how do I how do I send some
[52:37] text in? How do I get some text out? How
[52:39] do I switch to structured output? How do
[52:42] I optimize a prompt? How do I start
[52:44] measuring things? And so it's uh
[52:50] I wouldn't
[52:53] I would get used to whatever tools you
[52:55] start with, but like you're going to be
[52:57] able to learn all those concepts kind of
[52:59] regardless of the tools that you pick.
[53:01] Um,
[53:03] part of the reason I say this is because
[53:04] in industry a lot of folks overfocus on
[53:08] tools
[53:09] and underfocus on like the concepts that
[53:12] are kind of across tools and stuff like
[53:14] that. And so, um,
[53:19] it's good to learn tools, but I would
[53:20] say like tools in particular, like not
[53:23] to not to worry about it too too much.
[53:26] Like as long as you have like a good a
[53:27] good quality instructor, I think you're
[53:29] going to be in a good place. Like an
[53:32] instructor and and good I shouldn't even
[53:34] say it that way. Like an instructor an
[53:36] instructor that like speaks to you, you
[53:39] know, because like the instructor that's
[53:41] good for one person is going to be
[53:42] different than the instructor that's
[53:43] good for another person a lot of times.
[53:45] And so like find an instructor where you
[53:48] know if you can watch like one lecture
[53:50] and you're like, "Oh, I really learned a
[53:51] lot." Then like stick with that, you
[53:53] know, regardless of what tool they're
[53:54] using. And then you know once you've
[53:57] mastered that um then move on to you
[54:00] know trying out different tools try
[54:02] experimenting with different things. But
[54:04] a lot of it's really building momentum
[54:06] consistency of learning consistency of
[54:08] practice. Uh the the tools aren't um
[54:14] it's not as big of a deal. Um usually
[54:18] the people that will say it's a bigger
[54:20] deal are the people that are selling the
[54:21] tools. um to have a little bit of a you
[54:26] know conflict of interest uh for some of
[54:28] the educational stuff.
[54:34] That's good. That's good insight. I
[54:36] think thank you for I don't think I'm
[54:38] going to buy it, but I'm going to look
[54:40] into like how to ask good questions, you
[54:43] know, and own the questions like you
[54:45] said.
[54:47] Yeah.
[54:51] I also found that W3 schools helped me
[54:53] to learn the concept in in the course
[54:56] better in our course
[54:58] just so I could practice them more
[55:00] because it has this whole section on
[55:01] Python and libraries stacks and cues and
[55:04] everything.
[55:07] I used it
[55:09] and it actually taught it actually
[55:11] teaches almost the same way, same order
[55:17] and it's free.
[55:20] Yeah, there's there's a lot of good free
[55:23] content out there. The hard part is just
[55:24] finding it, you know, like
[55:27] Yeah.
[55:28] Um
[55:31] yeah, I would say that's that's the real
[55:32] hard part nowadays. And if you weren't a
[55:34] good machine learning um content place
[55:39] to start with um machine learning
[55:42] mastery, they have a um a lot of the
[55:46] like little basic intro stuff is is all
[55:50] free and then you can decide if you want
[55:52] to jump into one of their, you know,
[55:55] like get a paid paid something or not.
[56:01] Oh, cool. Machine
[56:05] learning Mastery. I'll look it up.
[56:07] Machine Learning Mastery.
[56:09] Yeah. And
[56:12] they they have a lot of uh lot of free
[56:15] stuff. Um
[56:24] so if you do one internship, you're not
[56:26] going to do a second internship, right?
[56:28] Because um we're doing the I'm doing the
[56:30] low code internship now.
[56:32] We probably won't be doing like a second
[56:34] in two, right? I don't know if anybody
[56:36] knows this.
[56:38] That's kind of up to you and your
[56:41] timeline um and what your your plans
[56:44] are. I I know I was on one and then
[56:47] realized it wasn't quite the the path
[56:49] for me, but that does extend my timeline
[56:51] a decent amount, you know.
[56:53] Yeah,
[56:54] I have until February, then I'm coming
[56:56] on two years. So I have to finish. Uh
[57:01] actually the local internship is a is a
[57:02] hidden blessing because now I can finish
[57:05] on time
[57:08] being finished by the end of the year.
[57:12] But then I still want to finish the rest
[57:13] of the course so I can know about you
[57:16] know the rest of the things libraries
[57:18] and dictionaries and things.
[57:25] Good.
[57:26] Well, I'm excited about the um
[57:28] hackathon. I mean, the challenge.
[57:32] Yeah. Katrina, do you have anything to
[57:34] add about I I I only uh posted the um
[57:38] the blurb from Dr. Emily's uh email and
[57:42] mentioned it.
[57:44] Yeah. So, we've kind of thrown it
[57:47] together in the past weeks, but I I have
[57:48] done React jams, you know, several times
[57:50] the past couple years. Uh, so we're
[57:53] taking that same energy that we get from
[57:54] the React Jam and putting it into a
[57:56] week-long challenge. And so our goal is
[57:59] to go from, you know, uh, go from zero
[58:03] to deployed in that week. And we're
[58:07] going to use that by utilizing AI and
[58:09] vibe coding with it. And so we're going
[58:11] to be taking the power of AI to iterate
[58:14] through
[58:15] uh, serving a couple different things.
[58:17] First off, showing new people that AI is
[58:20] still buggy and that you will still like
[58:23] showcasing that there's still going to
[58:26] be a need for developers. Um, second off
[58:30] coming back around and um
[58:34] then we show them how to debug and how
[58:37] to be able to to still get something out
[58:39] the door even if it wasn't perfect to
[58:42] begin with and how to iterate quickly
[58:43] with AI and in a team. Um, so lots and
[58:47] lots of great stuff coming down. We've
[58:49] got tons of experts. We've got lots of
[58:52] uh lots of team members who are
[58:54] participating with it and it's really
[58:56] going to be a lot of fun.
[58:58] So
[59:00] that sounds fun. Uh
[59:02] yeah.
[59:04] So So it's you're doing one it's uh like
[59:07] week long.
[59:09] Yeah. So it's it's next week. Um, and we
[59:12] we kick off on uh we kick up kick off on
[59:16] Sunday and then we code through um we've
[59:20] got sessions every evening at uh
[59:26] 900 p.m. Eastern. Um and so you'll
[59:29] likely see a bunch of students at your
[59:31] at your course because they're gonna
[59:33] have questions about AI. So tomorrow
[59:35] expect next times to be to be full
[59:38] because we'll probably have a lot of
[59:39] questions. Um,
[59:41] yeah. I mean, actually, I uh I'll see if
[59:44] Let me see what my calendar's like next
[59:46] week because um
[59:48] that would be awesome
[59:49] because I could also probably be around
[59:51] a little bit more. Yeah, we have we have
[59:54] a morning session which I think it would
[59:56] be really useful to to have uh some help
[59:59] for the students to help them with
[60:01] pushing their projects forward and and
[60:03] how to iterate better with AI and and
[60:05] how to really vibe code um and get
[60:08] effective results out of the AI instead
[60:10] of you know blundering and spinning
[60:12] around in circles and
[60:15] um so if you're available for uh a
[60:19] Wednesday afternoon or or sorry uh a
[60:23] Wednesday or Friday afternoon. That
[60:26] would be huge. Uh we have I I guess
[60:29] there it's actually morning, not
[60:30] afternoon. Sorry. It's um it's the
[60:33] morning session which is
[60:36] uh 11 a.m. Eastern.
[60:41] Okay. 11:00 a.m. Eastern. Uh I could let
[60:45] me see what my schedule's like next
[60:47] week. I could probably do that.
[60:50] I might be able to do that on Friday.
[60:52] Um,
[60:53] that would be so cool because Friday is
[60:55] they've already pres they would have
[60:56] already presented to Dr. Emily on
[60:58] Thursday night and then Friday is our
[61:01] day to deploy and so the Friday morning
[61:04] is get this last minute polish, get this
[61:07] last minute things and anything last,
[61:09] you know, finishing finalized touches.
[61:11] Uh, so that would be huge if you could
[61:13] help out on on that um on that Friday.
[61:17] That's the the first
[61:20] um
[61:21] What time zone is this looking at?
[61:24] Yeah, I see it on the calendar. So, it's
[61:26] uh
[61:26] You see it on calendar? Okay, great.
[61:27] Yeah.
[61:30] Yeah. So, then where where is everybody
[61:32] getting together? Just like in Discord
[61:33] or something.
[61:35] Uh I will have a Zoom room that's
[61:36] specialized for it. That way we're
[61:38] saving it online labeled under under
[61:40] challenge. Um, so it's actually I
[61:43] haven't put it up there cuz I haven't
[61:44] put the itinerary for that one yet cuz I
[61:46] wasn't sure exactly what we're going to
[61:48] be doing. But if you take a look down at
[61:49] at the Friday evening, uh, Braden is
[61:52] going to be helping us lead that one to
[61:54] to get people deploying on on Friday
[61:56] night.
[61:57] So that would be that would be epic if
[61:59] if you're available on Friday. That
[62:01] would be fantastic.
[62:02] Yeah, I could uh Yeah, I've got
[62:06] definitely I think I could do the Friday
[62:08] morning one. I might be able to do one
[62:10] of the other
[62:12] evening ones. Like Wednesday morning
[62:15] wouldn't work, but um
[62:17] Uhhuh.
[62:18] but I guess you know, you've got you've
[62:20] got my Discord, so like you can just
[62:21] sort of say like you'll probably see
[62:23] like after a day or two how things are
[62:25] going and then you know, just sort of
[62:27] like you know, let me know if you need a
[62:29] hand with particular things. Um cuz it's
[62:36] I it's it's so new. uh like heavy
[62:42] reliance on AI for coding is so new
[62:45] that
[62:46] uh like kind of everyone has a little
[62:49] bit of expertise but like no one has
[62:52] like full expertise yet.
[62:54] Mhm.
[62:56] Um
[62:59] like even the past couple
[63:00] would you be interested in maybe
[63:02] collabing with Dr. Emily on Monday
[63:04] morning? Uh, I think I could do that.
[63:08] So, she's doing one Monday morning.
[63:11] Yeah, Monday morning she's taking over
[63:13] doing the four pillars, but she would
[63:15] love somebody to be the hands to
[63:17] showcase vibe coding and to kind of, you
[63:20] know, uh, to showcase something. So,
[63:22] that might be an option as well. Uh, if
[63:24] you could get back to me as to which one
[63:26] would be better, the the Monday or the
[63:27] Friday, or if you if you're available
[63:30] for both, then that would be, you know,
[63:32] just
[63:32] uh, I think I would be available for
[63:34] both. I mean, for for actually being the
[63:36] hands of sort of showcasing Vive coding,
[63:38] it's
[63:40] how to put it. Uh
[63:42] I I won't claim to be good at Vive
[63:45] coding in all ways of Vive coding, but
[63:48] uh I've definitely done done a fair
[63:52] share of it.
[63:54] But yeah, I guess we can sort of uh
[63:57] check in online to sort of see um like
[63:59] what um
[64:01] like what kind of
[64:03] projects you're you're doing cuz cuz
[64:06] like you say, right, you you sort of
[64:07] like have to you have to actually kind
[64:10] of know what you're doing, but like
[64:12] Mhm.
[64:13] to be to be efficient and effective with
[64:15] it. Yeah.
[64:16] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean like like
[64:19] lately I've been using it. I've been
[64:22] adopting some of the vibe coding style
[64:24] for frontend work because I'm not great
[64:26] with front end.
[64:27] Um and
[64:31] it allows me to make changes more
[64:33] quickly. Um
[64:36] it's definitely like
[64:39] sending me on a path of pretty poorly
[64:43] factored code. uh
[64:46] you know it's
[64:48] so I got to I have to actually you know
[64:52] step in soon and really
[64:54] but yeah we'll touch base. I actually
[64:56] would like uh I'm going to be starting a
[64:57] meeting with peer mentors here in just a
[64:59] moment. Um and I can get back with you
[65:03] later as to kind of what what other
[65:04] additional support we might need.
[65:06] most likely we'll be sending people to
[65:08] your uh to your Friday night session to
[65:12] just kind of to talk about their
[65:13] experience and how and how it went. So
[65:16] yeah, no, I would be happy to happy to
[65:18] chat with that. Um yeah, the main reason
[65:20] I offered to for other stuff is because
[65:23] um you know if people need uh some
[65:26] pointers like earlier on or something
[65:27] like that um
[65:30] cuz it's
[65:35] a lot. Yeah. Yeah, it can be a lot. It
[65:37] can be a lot. And like it also can be a
[65:40] little bit
[65:41] like I've never actually
[65:44] started a project from scratch with with
[65:47] five coding
[65:48] and so I don't even know if that's good.
[65:50] Several so I think
[65:52] I
[65:54] uh well you start off from scratch
[65:58] basically I want to do this project. Uh
[66:00] so that'll be good. I think I think Dr.
[66:02] Emily I I was planning on doing Monday
[66:05] vibe coding that way with her. So, I
[66:07] think I'll do that with Monday. Okay.
[66:09] We'll talk about Friday a bit more
[66:11] Friday morning. Um because that that
[66:14] might be a stronger spot for you to come
[66:16] in and and have them ask questions and
[66:18] we'll have a we'll have a better knowhow
[66:20] come then if uh with it. So, um but I've
[66:23] got to pop out now. I've got to go get
[66:25] that meeting started.
[66:26] Yeah, I gotta got to start working on
[66:27] dinner over here. So,
[66:29] all right.
[66:31] Have a good one, everybody.
[66:33] Okay. Um All right.
