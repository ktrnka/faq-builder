# Content Categorization System Design

## Purpose

The goal of the categorization system is to identify clusters of content (Reddit threads and YouTube video chapters) that can be grouped together to create focused blog posts. This is not a general content organization system, but rather a tool to discover coherent topics that Keith has discussed extensively and that would make valuable blog content.

## Categorization Framework

### Three-Factor Approach

Based on the intended use case (blog post creation), the categorization system should factor content along three dimensions:

1. **Topic** - The technical or conceptual subject matter
2. **Application Domain** - The industry or field context (when applicable)
3. **Ideal Audience** - The target reader for potential blog posts

### Blog Post Creation Guidelines

**Content Volume Requirements:**
- Typically 3-4 Reddit posts OR 1-2 Reddit posts + 1-2 YouTube chapters per blog post
- Focus on topics where Keith has direct experience
- Acceptable to acknowledge knowledge gaps when clearly stated

**Blog Post Style:**
- Focused pieces addressing common questions
- Cross-domain topics preferred over domain-specific when possible
- Emphasis on practical insights from experience
- Clear about personal experience vs. general knowledge

## Initial Categorization Observations

### High-Potential Blog Topics Identified

From the content analyzed, several topic clusters emerged that could support focused blog posts:

**Career & Learning Topics:**
- Transitioning into AI/ML careers (multiple threads + YouTube content)
- Academic vs. industry research decisions (thesis guidance)
- Job application strategies and hiring process insights
- Learning programming and AI concepts effectively

**Technical Implementation Topics:**
- Model evaluation and comparison methodologies
- Data management for ML projects (especially rapid iteration)
- ML model deployment and monitoring in production
- Working with low-resource languages/domains

**Industry & Process Topics:**
- Healthcare AI project management and team dynamics
- AI tool selection and cost management
- Research methodology and experimental design
- Managing technical projects under time pressure

### Content Format Strengths

**Reddit content excels at:**
- Specific technical problem-solving
- Community expertise aggregation
- Detailed implementation guidance
- Research and academic perspective

**YouTube content excels at:**
- Career advice and industry insights
- Real-world project experiences
