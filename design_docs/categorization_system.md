# Content Categorization System Design

## Purpose

The goal of the categorization system is to identify clusters of content (Reddit threads and YouTube video chapters) that can be grouped together to create focused blog posts. This is not a general content organization system, but rather a tool to discover coherent topics that Keith has discussed extensively and that would make valuable blog content.

## Background Research

### Content Analysis Performed

**Reddit Threads Analyzed (10 total):**
- Simple Questions Thread (r/MachineLearning) - ML Q&A format
- Neural Network Improvements (r/MLQuestions) - Technical implementation
- ML Models in Production (r/MLQuestions) - MLOps and monitoring
- Multi-agent vs Translation Thesis (r/LanguageTechnology) - Career guidance
- Train/Test Split Comparison (r/MLQuestions) - Research methodology
- DVC for Rapid Data Ingestion (r/mlops) - Data management
- Thesis Research Ideas (r/MLQuestions) - Academic guidance
- Field Interest Discovery (r/LanguageTechnology) - Career exploration
- Language Identification SOTA (r/LanguageTechnology) - Technical specification
- Training on Native Languages (r/LanguageTechnology) - Resource-constrained ML

**YouTube Transcripts Analyzed (5 total):**
- Data Science Q&A sessions with project demos and UI feedback
- Job application challenges and hiring process insights
- AI tool comparison and programming workflow discussions
- Healthcare AI projects and team collaboration
- AI model cost estimation and technical implementation

### Content Patterns Identified

**Reddit Content Characteristics:**
- Question → expert response → follow-up pattern
- Mix of technical problems and career guidance
- Community-driven knowledge sharing
- Specific technical problems with detailed solutions
- Strong focus on practical implementation challenges

**YouTube Content Characteristics:**
- Conversational Q&A format
- Real-time problem solving and live coding demonstrations
- Career advice and industry insights
- Project development discussions
- Mix of planned content and spontaneous questions

## Categorization Framework

### Three-Factor Approach

Based on the intended use case (blog post creation), the categorization system should factor content along three dimensions:

1. **Topic** - The technical or conceptual subject matter
2. **Application Domain** - The industry or field context (when applicable)
3. **Ideal Audience** - The target reader for potential blog posts

### Blog Post Creation Guidelines

**Content Volume Requirements:**
- Typically 3-4 Reddit posts OR 1-2 Reddit posts + 1-2 YouTube chapters per blog post
- Focus on topics where Keith has direct experience
- Acceptable to acknowledge knowledge gaps when clearly stated

**Blog Post Style:**
- Focused pieces addressing common questions
- Cross-domain topics preferred over domain-specific when possible
- Emphasis on practical insights from experience
- Clear about personal experience vs. general knowledge

## Initial Categorization Observations

### High-Potential Blog Topics Identified

From the content analyzed, several topic clusters emerged that could support focused blog posts:

**Career & Learning Topics:**
- Transitioning into AI/ML careers (multiple threads + YouTube content)
- Academic vs. industry research decisions (thesis guidance)
- Job application strategies and hiring process insights
- Learning programming and AI concepts effectively

**Technical Implementation Topics:**
- Model evaluation and comparison methodologies
- Data management for ML projects (especially rapid iteration)
- ML model deployment and monitoring in production
- Working with low-resource languages/domains

**Industry & Process Topics:**
- Healthcare AI project management and team dynamics
- AI tool selection and cost management
- Research methodology and experimental design
- Managing technical projects under time pressure

### Content Format Strengths

**Reddit content excels at:**
- Specific technical problem-solving
- Community expertise aggregation
- Detailed implementation guidance
- Research and academic perspective

**YouTube content excels at:**
- Career advice and industry insights
- Real-world project experiences
- Process and workflow discussions
- Interactive problem-solving

2. Identify content gaps for high-priority blog topics
3. Create implementation plan for automated categorization
4. Validate blog post clusters with additional content analysis

## Design Considerations

### Scope Decisions
- Prioritize topics with Keith's direct experience
- Focus on practical, actionable content over comprehensive coverage
- Balance technical depth with accessibility
- Cross-domain applicability preferred when possible

### Technical Constraints
- System must handle both Reddit threads and YouTube chapters
- Categories should be specific enough to group related content
- Framework should be extensible as more content is analyzed
- Must support multi-label classification (content can span categories)

### Success Metrics
- Ability to identify 5-10 high-quality blog post topics from existing content
- Clear grouping of related discussions across different formats
- Minimal manual curation required for blog post creation
