Is it possible to start a chat in text then switch to audio later?
You said:
No, that's ok. Let me start by providing some written context for what we're going to do. I'd like to work to outline a blog post about my time in the gaming industry, focused on common topics and questions from people in the tech industry. I'd like you to adopt the role of the interviewer, adopting common expectations and norms of the tech industry. I'd like you to be candid and curious. After we've done a long interview session over audio then we'll switch back to text to summarize and outline it.

Any meta-questions? If not I'll start sharing some documents I'd like you to read that will seed the context
You said:
I'd like to focus more on insider Q&A, but if the conversation naturally leads to personal narratives that could be interesting too. We'll have to see what content we have at the end and decide whether to write one article, two, or more.

I don't have a precise idea for the interview length but let's aim for the 30-60 minutes range which should be long enough for us to cover all the breadth of topics and go deep on a few.

When I share the documents, please read them all and absorb quietly. If you'd like you can start the interview by asking me questions about them.

Here are a few links to read to start:

Singularity 6 is the studio behind the online game Palia, which combines cozy vibes and online gameplay.

Highlights:
- Built machine learning prototypes to solicit feedback from stakeholders and play testers
- Implemented language-based player grouping in matchmaking without requiring additional server scaling
- Learned Rust and Unreal Engine to fix bugs affecting >1.5M players

“Okay, let's begin.”
00:01
You said:
“Sure, so the first thing I want to say is that each different game is going to use machine learning in a different way. Many will not use it at all.”
00:10
You said:
“Some of that has to do with the studios and sort of studio culture. So there's some studios that are more positive on AI machine learning and some that are more negative on it. Within that scope though, you know, in Paleo my role was really to apply machine learning for our social systems. So things like helping people find friends or, you know, working on things like detecting hate speech. You know, on a more positive note, there are things like trying to give people the opportunity for friendship by sort of giving them the opportunity to get to know one another, which is sort of a precursor to friendship. There's kind of a wide range of areas. There's some other more traditional areas like store recommendations. So if your game has a story, you might do personalization and recommendations there. There's some that are more, you know, more traditional like machine translation or localization, you know, when you're in a pinch. And there's, you know, further afield, there's things people working with like, yeah, it's helped generate, you know, some parts of the art, but it's very sparingly used. And that's stuff that I wasn't involved with.”

“Yeah, let's talk about that a little bit more. So, when I joined Singularity 6, it was before the game had launched, and we had some alpha testers, but only some, and the game was being wrapped up. I think I had joined in maybe March or April of that year, and the game launch was like August of that year. And so, there was this kind of rapid finishing up the game period. We had a profanity filter, this rule-based one, that wasn't great, but we didn't really know that it wasn't great. It was really after the game launched that we knew that it had a lot of problems from seeing so many people play it, seeing the complaints on the forums and such. So, we didn't really fully appreciate that problem until then. And in parallel, there was a project by a peer of mine to do a machine learning approach to this. There were a number of challenges in that project, but that wasn't going to make it in time to help the players. One of the things I really did there was to help make it more data-driven to modify the rule-based profanity filter. Take a sample of chat messages, try to do that separated by language, basically build kind of like a CI pipeline for edits to the rule-based profanity filter, so we could actually see, like, okay, this rule is affecting this language in this way, this rule is affecting this thing in this way, this has too many false positives, this has too many false negatives, that sort of thing. And so, that helps refine it a lot to be more aligned with what people were actually saying in the game. And some of the examples, too, that I would test would be things that people shared, either on our subreddit or in our Discord. That sort of helped to try to find a better balance between actual player experience, what people were actually experiencing, and sort of our design goals around safety.”
02:29
You said:
“So safety is an area where it wasn't my core focus, although later on, I did work in some safety-adjacent areas. So my core project was really more positive social, sort of pro-social, rather than trying to detect and squash kind of antisocial behavior. So I'm trying to think where to start with that.”
00:30
You said:
“Actually, let me pause for a moment here and grab a coffee, and then I will rejoin the chat.”
00:06
You said:
“Okay, now where were we?”
00:01
You said:
“Yeah, let's get into it.”
00:01
You said:
“Yes, the main one was really, we called it SocialMatchMaker, or probably a better way to put it would be ProSocialMatchMaker. And I think you might even be able to find an old blog post about that for Paleo online somewhere. But that was even in the job description when I applied. And so I was hired for that, and I started working on that. But we didn't actually have player data yet, because it was hired before the game launched. We had very minimal player data. So I really started building out data pipelines, analyzing things, and trying to figure out how I wanted to think about that.”
00:45
You said:
“And, you know... Oh, go ahead.”
00:01
You said:
“I mean, I think it's an interesting project, and maybe I'll start high-level, and we can kind of, you know, go with whatever direction you think is most interesting. So, high-level was, I was hired for that, I looked into it for a bit, and then, you know, I kind of was embedded within the... I forget what the team was called, I think it was like meta-connections, so it was sort of like social systems, but the part about connecting people. And the other part was really meta-expressions, I think is what it was called, and that team was more about, like, chat or whatever, you know, direct stuff. Anyway, so, it was pretty clear to me that, like, meta-connections was trying to build all these features. They, you know, were fairly behind on schedule, so it was pretty clear that we weren't going to be able to build Social Matchmaker for launch. At least on this team together, and, you know, so then I looked at kind of their backlog and saw, you know, okay, what's out there? One of the things that was out there was friend recommendations. So, you know, with an online game, it's important that, you know, like, having friends in-game leads to sort of stickiness and retention, so that's really important. But, you know, you want to make it easy for people to make friends in-game, so that was what the friend recommendation system was about. So, I did a little prototype about that pretty early on, and then, you know, things kind of evolved. Eventually, I think that all got put kind of on pause, and then I came back to that, I think, the winter afterwards. I was learning more about our backend systems. I'd learned a bit about Rust, and I'd learned a bit about Unreal Engine, how to implement all these things. So, I sort of came back to it and was working toward, building towards implementing all of Social Matchmaker kind of by myself. And I'd gotten, like, sort of, I'd designed a sort of incremental delivery of that, starting with language-based Matchmaker. So, trying to put people on the same server that spoke the same language, which is a little bit complicated, because it differs sometimes from, you know, the language they pick in the UI. But, anyway, I started with that, and I got that out the door, and then, you know, it was probably, maybe like a month off from putting out a first version of Social Matchmaker, actually deploying it, when I was laid off. So, that's kind of like, you know, it went through a lot of twists and turns. And, you know, happy to explore whatever you think is most interesting, or what you want to hear more about.”
02:57
You said:
“For language-based matchmaking, I want to make sure that we're clear on what matchmaking is first. How aware are you of what matchmaking is in gaming and the history of it and the context of it?”
00:17
You said:
“Let me explain what makes it a little bit unique for Paleo. In a game like League of Legends, it's sort of like classic example matchmaking. You have five players on each side, and you want to make sure that they're... generally they speak the same language, but that there are similar skill levels that they all kind of have fun. Paleo, in contrast, is not competitive, and there's no server selection or anything. There's no matches. It's kind of like World of Warcraft, where you log in, and you explore the world, and you do what you want. So matchmaking in our context was this situation where a given server could hold maybe 25, 30 people computationally. So you might have the village map, and there might be 1,000 players on village, so 1,000 divided by 25 is how many servers you need. There's a lot of challenges of you turn servers on, you turn servers off, you kind of scale up, scale down to manage costs. There's a bunch of game design in terms of do you want your servers to feel kind of empty? Do you want your servers to feel crowded? Generally you want them to be fairly crowded, but you don't want people to have to wait for scale-up, because scale-up can take five minutes, so you have to actively scale-up. So matchmaking is like if you're going into the village zone of the game, and there are 20 servers that can fit you, that have space, which one should you be assigned to? So some of the basics are like, well, if you have any that your friends are on, go be assigned to that. And that was already built out.”

You said:
“So, I guess the core thing was really to, so we had player embeddings, most of our data was stored in Redis, so we had those stored in Redis, it was exported from our PySpark, our Databricks system into Redis, you know, a few times a day I think. Let's see, when someone joined a server, what we would do is we would update the Redis keys for the server, and we would say, okay, like add this player's embedding to the server's embedding, and when someone left the server, we would subtract it. And so, you know, by doing that over and over again, you know, like once you have a server with 20 players, the server embedding is the sum of the player embeddings that are currently on that server. And so, you know, that's sort of the general thing. And then when we were considering matchmaking, we had this part of the code base that would consider like, I don't know, like the 5 to 10 most dense servers that had enough space for you and anyone, if you were like in a party, anyone that was traveling with you. And so, I changed that from saying, instead of just like, just try to assign randomly or try to allocate to the quote-unquote best server, to allocate to the server that had the best embedding match with the player's embedding, you know, between the server with the highest co-sign between the server embedding and the player embedding. And I had to introduce, keep a little bit of randomness in there because that helps prevent like deadlock type situations or race conditions, like there was, there were a lot of parts of the code base that weren't a bit of randomness in there, but I made it sort of probabilistically random so that if, you know, say if you're a Chinese player and only one of those, say, five servers has anyone with Chinese, you know, that would be like a very high co-sign score and the others would be very low, and so there would be almost no chance that you get assigned to a server without the people, you know, in your language. So that was, I think that covers the basic idea of the technical design and some of the things like for time of day, really, you know, time of day effectively changes what the server embedding is. And so then, you know, essentially you'll have, you know, at night in North America you would have more servers that were mostly Chinese. That's what I saw after release too when analyzing it was that instead of having servers that were like nighttime servers that were like, you know, 80% English and 20% Chinese, we would have most, you know, 80% of servers were almost 100% English and then 20% of servers were almost 100% Chinese. So really trying to group people by language that way. And then, anyway, I'll sort of pause there and see, you know, what do you want to hear clarified and what are you curious about?”

You said:
“Yeah, I think, you know, what might be a good direction for interviewing right now would be to switch to talking about like common questions and misconceptions people have from the tech industry about the gaming industry. A lot of these things have come up in conversations with friends, you know, or maybe people have read that SISC 6 system architecture blog and, you know, we're confused about different parts. So why don't we try and take that direction for a bit.”
00:30
You said:
“Just go with some common ones, and, you know, I'm looking to you to kind of adopt that sort of traditional tech role, and, you know, start with some of the common ones.”
00:12
You said:
“Yeah, let's dive into the topic around sort of like the gaming industry is kind of chaotic and unstructured. Because I think that's one where our friends kind of bring that up. And my experience there has been that some of that chaos is unavoidable, is sort of necessary, is a necessary part of building a creative work, right? Building something that's for entertainment rather than like software that's for optimization. So some of it's essential, but most people don't quite realize that. And there's some of it that I would say is avoidable. So, you know, the avoidable stuff are like, you know, people that are in management roles and don't have, you know, management experience, or, you know, people kind of refusing to prioritize, that sort of thing. So there's a mixture of sort of like avoidable chaos that I think most people in the tech industry can kind of understand. Like everybody's had chaotic situations that didn't need to be chaotic. But there's a kind that's unavoidable and not everyone's had that experience. So I think that's a good starter. And then, you know, does that make sense?”

You said:
“I guess, you know, one adjacent topic that we could touch on is, like, just how competitive gaming is, like, you know, there are thousands of good games on Steam, and probably a hundred thousand, like, okay ones. And, you know, you're competing for attention with those other thousand, those other hundred thousand. And so, you know, that is really competitive. But, you know, there isn't much commitment from, like, a gamer to your game. You know, if they get bored, they just switch. Contrast that with, like, a subscription-based product, or, you know, a SaaS product, and there's, like, just a lot more inherent stickiness. And so that sort of hyper-competitive nature leads to a lot of really challenging things, where, say with Paleo, you know, we launched the game, and I think if we had, if our retention had been significantly better, you know, maybe, like, I forget what it was, but if it had been, like, a lot better, or, you know, if our launch had been, you know, 5 to 10x better, then the company would have done well. But, you know, you just don't really know. You know, people might play your game. They play it for a week. You know, they see, okay, this game doesn't feel finished, and they just move to a different game. And then they forget about it, and they never come back. And so that sort of business competition kind of trickles into a lot of things in the game development process, which is quite a bit different than a lot of software products, a lot of tech products, anyway.”
01:47
You said:
“I'm curious if there are any common questions you could think of related to that.”
00:03
You said:
“How about we explore the success one? Because, you know, on topics like game design, you know, I got to see it firsthand and work with them, but, you know, those are specialized roles, and I would say even though people had praised me for my product sense, you know, game design encompasses much more, so I don't think that I have the expertise there. So let's dive into that question of success metrics and data and that sort of thing. So maybe I'll start off kind of high-level, and then I'll look to you to kind of steer me one way or the other. So high-level, there's sort of, I'll say kind of quantity metrics and quality metrics. So quantity metrics is like how many people are playing the game, and quality metrics are sort of like retention or something like that. So you can get more people playing the game by just increasing your marketing budget, but ideally what you want is viral growth, like organic growth, and you want to see high retention so that the viral growth is kind of outpacing the natural churn. So that's one way of looking at it. Another way of looking at it is sort of like to break it down in terms of like where are different people coming from, how long are they staying, how much are they playing, how engaged are they, that sort of thing. And then there's, for us, we were free-to-play where you could buy cosmetics, and that's where our revenue came from. And so then there's like a whole sort of pipeline of like, well, we have user acquisition and churn, and that leads to a certain amount of play. And then some amount of players buy a skin or repeat buy a skin, or they might buy multiple times. And so you can kind of break it down as sort of a system of equations where each one is estimated separately or forecast separately and kind of look at it as sort of like, okay, is this part healthy, is this part healthy, is this part healthy? And yeah, I'll look to you to kind of steer me in whatever direction might be interesting to folks with a tech background.”
02:31
You said:
“Yeah, so I think one thing that's quite challenging, I mean, we had this challenge at SX, and I don't want to give anybody a tough time about that, but we had, you know, a well-established data team there, and, you know, we would share data, analyze this, that, and the other thing, and a surprising amount of the time, it didn't actually, like, lead to change. And I know the people that were dedicated for analysis roles, like, felt very frustrated by that. But that was the nature of it. In some cases, sort of, the designers or, I forget what they called their PMs, producers, I think, they sort of had a plan, and they were, like, hoping to deliver that whole plan before they got any data on that. And so, you know, it was, they weren't really ready for data, for many of them. Some of them were. And so, it did lead to things like we had a seasonal event that had really high engagement, like, unexpected. And so, that meant that when we were thinking about, like, the next iteration of seasonal events, that led to, like, drastically increased prioritization of that seasonal event. You know, more people were assigned to it, more senior people, that sort of thing. Otherwise, it was kind of, like, kind of minor adjustments. You know, people would look at the data and say, oh, you know, this wasn't going so well, this wasn't going so well. Or there were cases where, like, we would use data to find bugs, you know, things like, like, these numbers don't make sense, what's going on there, oh, it turns out it's a bug, or, like, sometimes it would be an exploit. So, that's generally how it got used there. Other, I think, more mature studios use data in kind of different, more mature ways. But my understanding was that the team there had been kind of formed under the expectation that the game would go big. And so, it was sort of, we were set up for this, like, kind of big, big development kind of vibe, even though that never really materialized. So, that's kind of, like, overview of things. Happy to dive into any parts that are adjacent to that, or, you know, expand on the details more if you'd like.”
02:37
You said:
“Um, let's see, I think we've probably talked enough about about data there. Um, I guess I can add a little bit more context on some of it. So for instance, like, there's a sense of like, okay, well, we just need users now. And that made people in the company, you know, a lot of the developers in the company pretty unhappy, because we, we all knew that the quality of the game wasn't where we wanted it to be. And so we're like, you know, if we acquire 2 million extra users, and they just all churn, you know, or most of them churn, then what do we get out of that, you know, like, but I think it was really a situation where leadership didn't really have a lot of like, good other ideas, or there wasn't a lot of strong evidence of like, the things that directly cause retention, increased retention or decreased churn. Over time, we started to get some, but only some. So that was one kind of like, complicating factor there. So a good example would be like, we initially launched on our website, we had our own launcher, was PC only. And we're doing like all this development work to get it launched on Nintendo Switch, we eventually got it out the door around Christmas time. That led to, you know, a huge increase of users. But the other challenges too, you know, it was very expensive development process, because our game hadn't been set up for it. And then there was this, you know, big development effort to get on Xbox and PlayStation five. That actually got kind of slowed down after all the layoffs, and then the acquisition, but you know, a year later, it sort of came around, and they got it out the door. But, you know, that was kind of the tension there of like, you know, do you focus on user growth? Or do you focus on retention? And in what order? You know, keeping in mind that, you know, if you can get a big launch pop, then maybe you don't have to do layoffs, right? So I think they were hoping that Nintendo Switch launch would, you know, get say 10 million users instead of two, and that might have made a material difference to us. But, you know, it's a smaller number, and there might have been, I can't remember if there were challenges with monetization or what, but there were a bunch of challenges. So it's just, you know, it's a complicated decision to make. And, you know, since gaming's hyper-competitive, you're competing against all the other games out there. You know, in that time period, we'd have things like we would make a major update, and some other really big-name games launched that week or the week before, and that's what people were playing. So they didn't see our update. So it's really challenging.”
03:04
You said:
“I'm curious what other kinds of like common questions people have about working in the game industry. You know, people that have a, like say, a tech background, but not a gaming background.”

You said:
“Let's move on from the sort of crunch work-life balance topic and and maybe move into I think you had some other interesting topics, too”
00:08
You said:
“Hmm. That's an interesting... I'm not sure I'm most qualified to talk about development process, but I think let's try it and, you know, see what we can get into there. So I'm trying to think of... I guess the process of development, like some parts of it are very similar to the tech industry where, you know, you have kind of a high-level plan, a high-level roadmap, you kind of break out the work into stuff you can allocate to teams, and this, that, and the other thing. And sometimes things go well, sometimes things, you know, you know, really aren't meeting their deadlines, or they're not meeting the quality bar. Any number of things happen. But yeah, I'm trying to think in what ways was it different. You know, there's definitely that, like, you got to find the fun before you can scale up kind of thing. There's definitely some times where you're sort of copying an established pattern, and so you have, like, a pretty good idea that there's going to be engagement. But I'm trying to think of an example of that. One was, like, nearby chat. So we had a pretty good idea that, like, that was common in other games, and people liked it and used it, and so, you know, that didn't need quite as much validation to go to implementation. And that one was actually one where there was, like, one game dev that was, like, particularly passionate about it, just, like, went and prototyped it and implemented it, and then that game dev sort of had the ear of the C-suite. So, you know, they were able to get rally support around that. It did help a little bit, but it didn't, like, you know, radically change things, like, it was sort of hyped up for. But, you know, it was also kind of, like, a relatively smaller implementation, so I can't complain too much. But there were some situations that were more, like, organic development, where you had individual people building some cool stuff. I think there was one where, like, you could throw snowballs at people, and that was just, like, someone made it and then got approval to ship it. Or there was one where, like, someone made, like, an obstacle course, and then, you know, enough people thought it was fun, so they shipped it. So there were more cases that were, like, kind of organic development, where it was people, you know, that played the game that were developers that kind of built something out, and then it got sort of promoted into a full thing. But there was a lot of, like, traditional, you know, software industry, like, roadmap type development. It's kind of a mix of the two. But, you know, maybe I'll pause there and sort of see if there's anything sort of surprising about that from a tech industry perspective.”

“Now, let's go back to... I think you had some other interesting questions about... I forget, maybe it was about player feedback or something like that?”
00:08
You said:
“Let's pick up the conversation around user feedback and player engagement.”
00:06
You said:
“Yeah, it is certainly dynamic. I think one real challenge is trying to, like, balance the internal vision for the game, sort of like what the developers wanted to do and sort of what they believe in, versus feedback from players. Sometimes players, you know, like, they might say, oh well, it does not this, it does not this, and it's like, really, you know, they want a different game entirely. Like, you know, it wouldn't be the same game at all with those changes. So, you know, you sort of have to tease that apart. And then there's some players that are really focused on, like, you know, specific things. They have, like, specific pet peeves. And then there's some that are, like, you know, it's very specific, you know, like, there might be, say, 5% of players want this one thing, like, different, you know, 7% of players want this conflicting thing, and so on and so forth. So, kind of a complicated situation. I'm curious to, I think it would be interesting to explore, like, the, sort of the, compare and contrast, like, user feedback in game development versus, say, user feedback in, you know, traditional software development. So, whether that was, like, when I was working in healthcare technology or consumer technology, user feedback could be different at times.”
01:18
You said:
“Yeah, maybe I can give one example that I think has really been on my mind for a while, which is I spent years working at 98.6, it was a healthcare tech company, we provided primary care through an app, and we did pretty well, I was there for about 6 years, and then I spent a year at Singularity 6 working on the game Paleo, and you know, again, it did pretty well, like in the end, both startups didn't really make it, but they did pretty well for a time. And one of the things that really kind of stood out at me was that the percentage of users that were engaged in feedback with Paleo was significantly higher than those with 98.6. And that's always kind of stuck out to my mind, you know, of like, you know, healthcare is really quite important, it's about our health and our lives, and you know, it was pretty generally fairly rare for us to get unsolicited feedback there, I mean, most of it was positive, so you know, that was good, but you know, it was much less passionate than sort of the gaming feedback, where the gaming feedback was extremely, extremely passionate, you know, sometimes to the point of being inflammatory and whatnot, but you know, in terms of the importance to people's lives, it's like, you know, I'm not really sure how to reconcile that, because you know, it's a game, it's not people's lives, it's not people's health, really. And then even financially, like, the dollar amounts were significantly higher in healthcare, you know, compared to like free-to-play gaming, where like, most of our players did not pay at all. And so, I don't know, that's always just been kind of on my mind, I thought that was kind of an interesting dilemma, you know, the only thing that, you know, came to mind with that, is that it's different groups of people, right, so gamers, you know, skew a little bit younger than the people engaged with healthcare, and also it's like, kind of a level of time commitment, so you know, the people playing the video game that were probably engaged are people that are put in like, you know, 10 hours into the game, or 100 hours into the game, or you know, some of them were put in 1000 hours into the game, whereas like people in healthcare, if someone was using 98.6, they may have like spent, you know, 15 minutes in the app with us, and we provided this wonderful service to them, but, and maybe we even saved them like a couple hours of time, but, so yeah, it's always been on the back of my mind, just that like, the quantity and the type of feedback was so radically different, kind of disproportionate with the actual impact to people's lives.”

“Yeah, and I will say like in both cases, you know, user feedback did affect, like, you know, influence the development roadmap, but there was just, you know, so much more of it in the gaming space. Like in the gaming space, the amount of feedback was overwhelming for our company, right? So we had maybe 200 people at the company, and then maybe 3 million players or something like that, and you know, it's like a subset of them, of course, that are actively providing feedback, but it's just like a massive challenge. You know, some of the feedback is on forums, of course, and we can only keep up with so much of that, especially since there's only like so many community managers dedicated to it. And then, you know, some of the feedback is, you know, like posts or blogs or whatnot. And then, you know, even like our first week, we had, you know, there were more hours of footage with our game on Twitch than we could ever hope to consume or help to analyze. You know, in contrast with medicine, where, you know, I think if someone had recorded, like, their experience in the app and said, okay, here's what we have had this problem, we would have been delighted because we were kind of, at 98.6, we were kind of, like, starved for that specific feedback. And then in gaming, we were kind of, like, drowning in it.”
01:23
You said:
“Yeah, and another aspect of it, too, that I found really fascinating was that, you know, sort of player feedback and player interaction was such a big topic. And because there were, you know, sort of high emotions in the space, a lot of them really invested players. You know, we had to have, like, training even to engage with players, so, you know, they sort of trained us on, you know, what to expect from, like, parasocial relationships, and, you know, oh, you know, their players might see you as a dev, and so, you know, that's kind of this, like, almost like demigod status to some people, even though you're just a regular person, really. And, you know, we had to sort of plan for that, prepare for that. So, you know, I remember my first player interactions, you know, at Singularity 6 were, you know, I was really nervous about it, you know, did I get the—am I going to get the tone right? Am I going to respond well enough? You know, it all went fine. I was very kind of cautious about what I responded to, but, you know, it just kind of surprised me in contrast to other experiences, like, you know, a different experience, like, where I had engaged with some of our users back at Swype. This was for typing on mobile phones. We had some forums, or we had, like, an alpha tester group, and with alpha groups, I feel much more comfortable, because they're kind of, like, friendly, you know, they're kind of selected to be friendly, cooperative folks, you know, whether that was for Swype or for Paleo. And so, you know, I feel much safer and more comfortable interacting with those folks. But with Swype, you know, I interacted publicly on our forums, too, and I felt a little bit of nerves with that, but nothing nearly as much as I did for Paleo, even though, you know, it's much older. So, you know, that's another, like, kind of big difference in, sort of, user interaction that I've seen there, which kind of surprised me, you know. I really, I was vaguely aware of it for, like, big companies, you know, big games like World of Warcraft, where, you know, like, a dev had this, like, blue post, and, you know, it's this, like, really important thing, and people would quote it and analyze it, all this stuff. But, yeah, it was kind of, it was interesting to experience it firsthand.”
02:23
You said:
“Yeah, it was. So I think we've covered player feedback pretty well. I guess the only one thing to add that I noticed on the features that I worked on was that, by and large, even for the stuff that I worked on directly, like when I was trying to learn to be the fullest stack developer, even then, when I had chipped some bugs, for instance, it's more like the source of complaints went away. There wasn't, like, gratitude for the fix so much as the complaints reduced. And, yeah, I don't know. That's always kind of stuck in my mind, because it was hard work fixing some of those bugs. But occasionally there would be gratitude, or, like, if I had explained sort of what happened or why or what we were trying to do about it, people were grateful for that. Yeah, it was kind of, you know, it was like, huh, that's kind of weird. You know, like, there would be, like, appreciation for these, like, very large, you know, huge feature developments, but not as much for things that, like, it affected, like, quite a lot of people, you know, whether negatively or positively. It's more, you know, complaining for the negative stuff. Very limited praise for the positive.”
01:22
You said:
“Yeah, that actually did remind me about a topic we haven't talked about yet, which is sort of the sort of quest to become like the fullest stack developer. And I think that might be an interesting topic because that's rooted in some of my management experience from 98.6, from the health care company. And then, you know, I got to try out some more things at Singularity 6 and, you know, learned in some ways how I was right and in some ways I was wrong about that actually. Before we get into that, like, does that term full stack dev make sense? Or like, you know, even the sort of like idea of like the fullest stack dev, just, you know, does that seem intuitive?”

You said:
“Yeah, I think there were a couple other aspects that I thought would be interesting to talk about to kind of, you know, to compare and contrast between, I'll say, the tech industry and gaming industry. Were there any topics that I mentioned so far that we haven't really dug into, or, you know, common questions that we haven't really dug into that are within my area of expertise?”
00:21
You said:
“Yeah, let's dive into communication styles, and then I think we've mostly talked about scaling, but maybe we could talk about that a little bit more. And then a third one that I just remembered was monetization. That comes up fairly often. And then, yeah, I think those are good ones. So thinking about communication, I would say, yeah, generally, you know, communication was a bit more chaotic. It was a bit, you know, we had a slack, but like it was fairly disorganized, and people would kind of jump in and just sort of like wouldn't, they would like just blurt stuff out. It wouldn't necessarily be like fully formed thoughts. You know, there would be, one of the things I learned at 98.6 was that like it's important to identify like what kind of communication venue is most appropriate. So there are times when something should be an email. So an email is good if like you're not really sure who to include, and it's not very time sensitive, and needs, you know, a bit more context. So that way you can like put much more context into it, and then you can kind of add people later as needed, right? So emails are really good for that kind of a thing. There are times when there's like back and forth discussion. I kind of learned this in the Google Docs comments, where if it was like, you know, just like one like quick little comment, then that's fine. But I learned pretty quickly that they would devolve into these like massive unresolved threads, and that was a sign to me that actually like a meeting was much more effective at resolving that. Usually because there were discussions between multiple parties, and usually because, you know, there were parties that were very busy, so they didn't have time for Slack. And then, you know, like Slack has its place too. I don't mean to say, I would say Slack is kind of the default in my mind, but there's sort of a decision there about like, you know, do you start as like direct messages, or group direct messages, or sort of like in a private channel, in a public channel? And so I would say like Essex was kind of more leaned towards Slack for everything, but had a tendency to like do too much in private chats, until it was kind of like too late, and then you couldn't really add people very well. So a bit more chaotic overall, like a bit less, I would say, thoughtful and intentional about communication. At least, you know, as at a company level, I would say like leadership tried to be, you know, deliberate and communicative, but kind of the same class of problems of like, you know, superficial takes on KPIs or whatnot, that didn't necessarily get to the heart of like what people actually needed. But I think that mostly covers communication styles. You know, there's some like gamer speak, of course, it's like leans to less mature stuff, less maturity. But, you know, otherwise, it wasn't too different. It was more about like organization than anything else.”

Oh I hit the limit for advanced voice. Is the limit different for different plans

You said:
I noticed in the interface it says no transcription available for a lot of my chats. Is that something where you can see what it is, or it's just gone entirely?
You said:
“Sure, before we go much further, let's discuss options for how we can, I don't know, mitigate that problem going forward, because a lot of the value in this session is really in trying to elaborate my experiences with your help so that we can really build up a library of things to talk about in blogs. But if the transcript isn't available, then I'm not sure how much we can really do that.”
00:35
You said:
“OK, actually, I'm curious if it would be possible for you to let me know situations where, for instance, you can see where you're responding to and respond to me, but maybe where the transcript isn't available. Because right now, I'm walking around, so I'm not looking at the screen. So I actually didn't notice that the transcripts weren't available until I went into the app to start a new voice session. So is that something you can let me know in the future?”
00:33
You said:
“Okay, great. So, can you look over the, you know, the context that we have so far and identify any sections where maybe it looks like I had answered a question or talked about a topic, but we don't have a transcript, and maybe we can, you know, briefly redo some of those?”
00:19
You said:
“No transcription available”
03:22
You said:
“Uh, I think that covers most of monetization. There were, you know, of course there are some challenges of like, like Stripe, I think, wasn't supported for many of our European players, and so, you know, we had to actually do different payment methods. But once we were on, like, Steam and Nintendo Switch, that just sort of took care of all that, so that helped a bit. Anyway, I think that's all I've got in terms of monetization. So let's pause there and sort of see what other topics that we're currently missing transcripts for and we need to dive into.”
00:40
You said:
“Okay, great. So, you know, my background before that was in healthcare technology. And so, you know, for us in healthcare tech, it was really important that we have, like, as close to 100% uptime as possible. So, you know, we would count the nines of uptime like AWS people do. And, you know, we were trying to do, you know, 99.95 or something like that. You know, in contrast with S6, you know, it was kind of like old school World of Warcraft where there'd be planned downtime on Tuesdays, and, you know, it'd be down for anywhere from, like, two hours to 10 hours, maybe. And so, like, sort of by design, we can't achieve 99.9% uptime. But some of that was really driven by constraints from Unreal Engine. So, you know, Unreal Engine, we were using both the client and the server. So, the client running on, you know, the individual's hardware, and then the server was running on AWS, and that's connecting to, like, our backend systems also in AWS. And, you know, you really had to deploy them simultaneously. And, you know, they didn't have, like, a good way to deal with, like, you know, old clients on new servers or vice versa. And so, you know, downtime was just necessary. And then, you know, there was another part, I think we talked about scalability in there. You were saying that part got cut out. So, scaling, it's really tough to anticipate. You know, your player base, you try your best to do surveys and guesstimate, but you really don't know what it's going to be like on day one. And, you know, initially, we kind of let waves of players in, and sort of, like, we would let some waves of players in until the server, we had a bunch of crashes, and then we'd fix those and let some more waves of players in. But I think we got really too ambitious with the last couple of waves. And then that led to persistent problems for the people working on, like, matchmaker and service scaling for, oh, I don't know, you know, they were working late nights for three, four weeks to resolve a lot of that. So, that's one challenge. And then maybe I'll pause there, see if you got all that, and then I can go on with a couple more maybe challenges in the scaling space.”
02:32
You said:
“Yeah, so one topic on scaling that I found really fascinating was... So, let's see, as I said before, we had servers allocated per map in-game, per zone. And so we would need a certain number of servers of each zone in each region to support that player load, and we would try to over-allocate by some percentage so that there were servers ready to go if we got like a little surge of players. So that's kind of the general gist of it. Now, one scaling issue we had, and like the patterns were fairly regular for a while. People would kind of organically flow around the servers, and so there wouldn't be these like sudden spikes. Now, the problem started to really come in when we started to have like timed events. So events where in-game, like one in-game day mapped to one in-real-life hour. So the top of the hour in real life was midnight in-game, like over and over again. And the problem we started to have was when we started to have timed events. So we had events that happened systematically at midnight in-game or at 2 a.m. in-game or whatnot, particularly when they were really well-received events or events that players played a lot, that would cause a situation where like there would be this mass exodus of players from every other zone to that one particular zone that had the event. And so that created the situation where there was like this hourly cadence of player flow to one particular zone. Well, our auto scaling was really set up for like a five or 10% buffer. And that feature wasn't really designed to like pre-scale that zone. So what would tend to happen is that there would be like queues and such. So that was the situation where like, sort of maybe with better team coordination, we could have done better on that one, but it was sort of a situation where the game design itself actually like ended up causing some challenges in our auto scaling setup.”
02:24
You said:
“Um, I don't know. Are there any topics where we sort of like covered it a little bit, but not really, or it seemed like something to come back to? I think the topics that I'm most interested in are things that like, you know, people in the tech industry have a certain way of working, and they kind of expect that everyone works that way. And then when you go into the game industry, you find some things work differently, or very differently, or subtly differently. Um, and at first, a lot of people from the tech industry might think, oh, that's crazy. Why don't they do it the way that I'm used to? But, you know, as you work in the game industry, you start to see that a lot of things are for a reason. You know, not everything is, of course, but a lot of things are for a reason. And so I'm really looking to make sure we cover all of those topics pretty well.”
00:45
You said:
“Yeah, so that's an interesting point. Because to me, what I've seen over the years is, well, I guess it goes through cycles maybe. But both my experience at 98.6 and my experience actually at Nuance and Swype and Singularity 6, in all cases, people were pretty specialized. In some cases, like over-specialized. And I would say that becoming more of a generalist tends to enable more adaptability to uncertain roadmaps. You can really have a lot of specialists. And that specialist development can be really effective if you have a clear understanding of the roadmap. So we had that, say, for instance, at Nuance, where the roadmap was kind of far out in the future and was pretty clear most of the time. And our scope was very limited. The scope of our product was very limited there. So I wouldn't really say that I don't know exactly that specialization versus generalization is totally different. Though I will say at Singularity 6, very few people did. Maybe nobody did both back-end and game dev at Singularity 6, whereas at 98.6, a few people did both front-end and back-end. But it was pretty separated. So I'm curious your take on that, too, because from my perspective, it seemed like, I don't know, I think having a good number of generalists is important to having high-performing organizations, especially if they're small. But a lot of these cases were highly specialized organizations. And maybe full context, I mean, my background is machine learning, which is highly specialized. So it could be that the places that need me tend to be highly specialized. But I'm curious to hear your take.”
02:16
You said:
“I think, also, there's something you said that got me thinking, which is... It got me thinking a little bit about indie development, where you have small teams of less than five building a whole game, and in those scenarios, you have people that are more generalized. In contrast, in startups, I guess there's a lot of startups that are pre-seed or seed startups that never go much further, and maybe they're at that level of five to ten people. But you still see pretty successful indie games at that small scale. So I think there are some where people that are really passionate will be more open to becoming a generalist. It's hard work. So I think there might be some subtle differences, but Singularity6 was already like 200 people when I joined, so I didn't get to see it there.”
01:05
You said:
“Let's try to identify some gaps or some areas where my thinking seems incomplete so far. So things that I haven't talked about that I probably should have talked about that are common questions from tech folks, or things where I have a stance on something that really should be challenged. Let's dive into some mix of those and feel free to pick whatever you think is the best place to start with that.”
00:31
You said:
“Yeah, let's do that. So, you know, one thing that actually came up over and over again at Singularity 6 was, you know, those of us with a tech background, especially with a mature software development background, you know, we had all really experienced what it was like to do feature flags, you know, to ship software and turn it on later or turn it off if we needed to without having to ship a full update. And, you know, all of us over and over again had really wanted, like, a feature flag system for Paleo so that we could effect, like, decouple some of our, you know, turning things on from when we actually ship an update, you know, so that we, in that case, it would be like to enable, make it more safe so we could, like, roll back faster so that we could iterate a little bit faster with, you know, still safety. So that came up a lot.”
00:57
You said:
“Yeah, we could also get into internal builds and that stuff. So, you know, that's a situation where, you know, we would have builds, and we would play, like the entire company would play on our internal builds, you know, once a week or twice a week, sometimes even, you know, specialized builds, you know, for specialized levels or whatnot. But, you know, that's where we would kind of like test these things pretty often, or QA would test these things pretty often. But, you know, that's a situation where, essentially, you know, something's being shipped to, you know, 10 people or 50 people, or, you know, maybe 100 people. It really just doesn't hold up to, you know, shipping to 100,000 to a million people. You're just not going to catch as many edge cases that way.”
00:58
You said:
“No transcription available”
02:44
You said:
“Are there any other sort of gaps in coverage, like things that we talked about briefly, but we only kind of brushed across it that would be interesting topics for people from a tech background without a gaming background?”
00:16
You said:
“So maybe we can briefly talk about some topics in LiveOps and sort of how that's different from tech. You know, I think a lot of it really comes down to, you know, the player base is very passionate and very vocal, and that leads to a lot of differences, especially if you have a big player base. And so that can lead to things like bandwagoning, you know, where you get groups of people that kind of want to support each other, and so they sort of reinforce one another's opinions, whether positive or negative. And then you can get groups of people kind of fighting against each other, all kinds of things, but... I would say, you know, a lot of it's just communicating with players, and sometimes there's, like, people speculate on something. You know, for instance, for one of my features, I had run a player survey, and it sort of told the CMs what it was for, but some players were kind of freaked out about it several months later, like, long after I had sort of stopped working on that. And so, you know, I said, brought something up at the moment, I had a document ready to go, but by the time it came up, I didn't even remember where the document was. And the player misunderstood some of the things, which means that we probably could have explained it better, but... So anyway, that was one story. And then another story was that, especially right at launch, a lot of players were kind of frustrated about the quality of the game, especially players that had been in the beta tests. They're sort of saying, like, oh, well, we brought up all these issues, but you didn't fix them. And, you know, a lot of issues got fixed, but not as many as anyone would have liked. And, you know, so that led to a situation where there was, you know, a bit of negativity, and, like, some of the devs just, they were like, you know, I'm not looking at any feedback anymore. Like, I'm not engaging with anyone. Or maybe they weren't trained well, and they sort of, like, just sort of said something, and, you know, it got taken out of context, and they got a bit attacked, and then just said, oh, I'm not engaging with players ever again, kind of thing. So, you know, that, I think, can be a bit of a difference. But, you know, otherwise, a lot of the things I was saying, you know, you're transparent about downtime, you're transparent about, you know, major changes, you know, you kind of respond to things as they come up. But a lot of it comes down to, I think, the passion of the community, and the, just, like, how many people there are, really.”
02:38
You said:
“OK, so I think one, I have to go in a minute here, so I'll have to pause in a minute. But one thing I'd like you to do is to look over what we've discussed so far and identify maybe one or two areas where my thinking doesn't sound right or maybe is confusing or needs refinement.”
00:26
You said:
It looks like we've covered a good amount of ground in our discussion!

Now let's transition into the blog planning stage. I suspect we have multiple categories of topics here that could become different posts, or some might not be appropriate as posts. As a first step I'll give you three areas to consider and I'd like you to review everything in detail and categorize topics into a rough outline for us to discuss. If there are some that don't fit, propose new categories. If there are some topics that might need to be split up, consider that too.

The three broad categories of topics that could individually be blog posts:
- Technical implementations I did on Palia. I'd just need to be careful about this because we don't want to enable any exploits so we may need to flag topics as exploitable or not. 
- Cultural notes and observations for people from the tech industry. This is the best topic I think
- System design observations from my peers. In general if it's their work I don't think I'd blog about it heavily, but we should separate this as a category
You said:
It looks like a lot of things tagged as technical implementations I did are actually about implementations that other people did. At a glance, I talked about scaling but that was mainly other peoples work. Likewise monetization wasn't entirely my work
You said:
Let's do a grab-bag post covering the wide range of Cultural notes & observations for tech folks. Draft a section outline, making sure that it flows nicely from one section to the next. For the purpose of drafting, just list out lots of quotes from me about each topic. Then add your own perspective about how I might consider elaborating on it or filling it in to make sure that it's interesting for folks with a tech background.

For each section, consider whether it's actually unique to gaming and therefore a value-add for tech folks. For example, the challenge of regional pricing isn't unique to gaming but perhaps gaming studios hit that challenge much sooner
You said:
Let's enhance this significantly, adding more quotes and/or sections. Then I can filter it afterwards. So focus on high recall here.

Also some specific things I'd like to include:
- Elaborate more on necessary chaos, and how some of that comes from the need to innovate to build engaging entertainment
- I'd love to elaborate on the spectrum of dogfooding and playtesting
- Timed events vs autoscaling is more of a topic in the category of innovation leading to more challenging code (chaos as a part of innovation)
- Definitely more examples in the firehose of feedback
- In measuring success, it's not all that different from other situations: You measure engagement. Though with gaming it's more fine grained to the point of measuring CCU not just DAU MAU etc. Since people can churn quickly, you can measure retention pretty quickly
- On the topic of scaling, that makes autoscaling MUCH more important in gaming

Another topic that comes to mind is FTUE, which has radically more attention in gaming than tech. Certainly in tech we want to optimize the onboarding experience but onboarding is usually pretty simple. Most apps aren't all that complex so you don't need to teach people so much.

In gaming there was a really interesting aspect of tutorials/hints vs quests. It was much better to teach someone how to do something by giving them a quest that forced them to learn, rather than bombarding them with tutorial popups or hints. Some tech apps do that but I don't see it as often

Other topics that I think are interesting to bring up:
- The tooling ecosystem (Unreal Engine feels a bit like Android Studio but less polished. Perforce feels like git plus DVC but less polished, and so on)
- The platform/app ecosystem (Steam is similar to publishing an app on iOS/Android. Nintento/Xbox/Sony felt very different)
You said:
Look carefully and collate everything I said about A/B testing and feature flags. Start with literal quotes then add your own version afterwards
You said:
Find literal quotes from me about necessary chaos
You said:
Help me consider and contrast the difference between "search" or "finding the fun" and "discovery" as the common concept for PMs. To me they feel similar but discovery seems to assert that there's an easily knowable solution waiting to be found, which is not the case with gaming
You said:
Let's explore an adjacent blog topic. I've been asked about machine learning and AI in gaming many times over the years and it might be good to answer some of the common and interesting questions I've gotten. Some of those range from:
- Is ML used to detect cheating?
- Will AI replace artists?
- How is AI/ML used in gaming?

Before we discuss any of those, what are some other common beginner questions about AI/ML in the gaming space? I'd like to ensure that we have a good breadth of questions
You said:
“Can you hear me now?”
00:00
You said:
“OK, I'll start with that first question, and then we can dive into topics that you think are best. And I do want to try to be clear about areas where I'm speculating, or where I have experience, or where I have a little bit of experience, but not a lot. So the first question was really about, how does game AI relate to what we would call AI in the tech space or machine learning? And so game AI is sort of like controlling enemies, and sort of movement, pathfinding, might include. I think you mentioned dialogue trees. I hadn't heard of people calling that AI, but I could imagine that there being some options there. I think game AI is more closely related to the field of artificial intelligence, sort of like your classic Russell and Norvig style artificial intelligence. And then what people in general practice outside of the gaming space have called AI is more like applications of large language models, and then some things like image generation. And so the term in the general space has drifted quite a bit. I will also say, though, that it does make job descriptions kind of tough. So you'll see gaming job descriptions looking for AI. And most of them are looking for rule-based enemy control. But a small number of them are looking for AI machine learning, LLM type stuff. Although those ones usually use, they try to use different terms because it's confusing. But anyway, that's kind of like the little bit that I have on that first topic there. What's a good next topic to talk about?”

You said:
“No transcription available”
04:32
You said:
“Yeah, maybe I'll add one more thing to that. I'm trying to remember what it was that you had last said at that before you had gone on. Let me think here.”
00:14
You said:
“What was the thing, like, right before the last question that you asked?”
00:04
You said:
“I think there was something in the AI artist part that you had mentioned at the very end, and that gave me an idea, but then I got distracted when you mentioned the other ideas.”
00:09
You said:
“Oh, you had mentioned creativity, now I remember. So that's one thing I did want to mention, which is that AI isn't really going to solve the creativity challenge, and a big part of games is making something entertaining and fun. A part of being entertaining is novelty, and Gen AI isn't so much about creating novelty as sort of imitating the data that it's seen. And so it's not really a good fit for trying to create novelty. It's a better fit for copying existing things. So if there are existing styles in a game and you want to create more things like that, but slightly refined, then it might help with that. But I don't see it as a good fit at all for creating something new.”
00:52
You said:
“Yeah, well, it's nice.”
00:00

“So I would say a lot of the categories of analytics or personalization are very similar to the way that AI and machine learning are applied in the technology industry. So we build recommender systems in the gaming industry very similar to recommender systems outside the gaming industry, whether that's for shopping or for meeting people or any number of things. So that's pretty much the same for content filtering, same kind of deal, AI has a lot of common applications for that, AI has a lot of common applications in translation as well, that's sort of common across industries. I would say just as a general rule, a lot of the applications of AI that I've seen that have been more successful in the gaming space are ones that are also successful in the tech space.”

“So I don't have experience in procedural content generation, so I don't want to comment on that one. But, you know, when it comes to cheating, someone had asked me a question about that once. And, you know, what I said was that on Paleo, we didn't get to the point where that was necessary. You know, very basic statistical filters caught cheating. So if we saw people that were making, you know, 10,000 gold per hour, when, you know, a typical player makes maybe 100 gold per hour or 1,000 gold per hour, then, you know, they were kind of just really just stick out. We don't really need machine learning to identify players like that. Although, you know, of course, we want to verify that it is actually cheating and isn't just, you know, someone found, you know, a good way to do something. And so we sort of have to look at the data. So all the hard work there is really in, like, trying to make sure that the data is clean and trying to, like, aggregate data across many different sources and sort of piece together, like, a complete picture of what's going on. So, you know, in that particular game, we never really got to the scale where ML made sense. Now, for a very large game or a very, you know, more competitive game where players have more feel, some players feel more incentive to cheat, you know, those are games where you might start to use machine learning, you know, for things like players that systematically get into positions that they shouldn't be getting into. For instance, you know, if someone gets into a weird position once in a while, it might be a bug. But if they're doing it systematically, then that's probably cheating. You know, there's a lot of types of things like that where it's more, it's tough to define, like, an exact rule on some of these things, or maybe it requires a combination of signals. Maybe it's a combination of, you know, gold per hour and sort of movement speed in the game. It might be a really clear signal. And so you can do machine learning for these things, but it's really like you would only want to do that at a certain scale of game where it's really worth your time to shut that down. But what we saw was really that the most common behaviors are detected fairly easily with relatively simple statistical methods.”

“I think that covers some of the things that I have in mind, but maybe we can talk a little bit about, see if there are any topics that might be interested in applications of AIML for writing, or other kinds of creative tasks.”

“I think that's right. I think, yeah, I think that's a good way to put it, is that if it's used well, it could probably be used to assist writers. You know, one of the challenges we had was that there was just so much dialogue in our game that it was really hard for the writers to keep track of it all. And, you know, perhaps that's a situation where maybe we needed some better, like, dialogue management software. So that might actually be something worth live coding. But, yeah, it was sometimes difficult to keep the dialogues consistent, you know, the information consistent. And, you know, maybe AI could have some role in some of those challenging tasks that involve, you know, looking across lots and lots of dialogue, you know, collating information, that sort of thing. Some of it, too, is, like, translation is really hard, and there's a lot of, like, stylistic elements in writing, and you kind of want to capture the style of things as well. So, you know, basic machine translation doesn't do a great job at that. But you could probably use, you know, like large language models to transfer not just the meaning of the dialogue, but also, like, the style of that dialogue, and sort of how all the different kinds fit together. You could also probably do some, like, proofreading, too. So, you know, in terms of, like, picking character names in a multilingual environment, you know, like spot checking that the names, like, don't mean weird things in certain languages. So I think there are a lot of, like, little ways to use it to sort of speed up some of the feedback process.”
