# Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
See the README.md

## Interaction Guidelines
- When making design decisions that will significantly affect future development, consider how it will fit into the long-term vision and ask for feedback on the approach.
- If instructions don't seem feasible (e.g., extracting data that doesn't exist in the source, conflicting requirements), stop development and ask for guidance rather than making assumptions. Clear communication prevents wasted effort and ensures the right solution.
- **For bug reports and data quality issues**: Always start with TDD - create a failing test that reproduces the problem before attempting any fixes
- **For new features**: Ask whether to use TDD or implement directly, depending on complexity and risk
- After completing a major feature or refactor, do a small post-mortem. Reflect on what went well and what could be improved. Then consider some small incremental changes to our development process that might improve our workflow. Then review them with me and collaborate to update the copilot instructions.
