I'm from northern New Jersey outside of New York City. I used to be a computer science professor and have been training elite software developers for over a decade. I've graduated dozens of them. Tonight, I'll share everything I know about how you can become that elite software developer and tech innovator."

After that, you might become a staff engineer with salaries from 200 to 350k, and at top companies like Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, or Google, salaries can reach a million dollars or more."
